administrative sanction fee of SEK 4,000,000 (four million).
The Data Inspectorate submits pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) i
data protection ordinance Karolinska University Hospital to ensure that
required needs and risk analysis is performed and documented for
the journal system TakeCare and that thereafter, with the support of needs and
risk analysis, each user is assigned individual privileges to access
personal data to only what is needed for the individual to be able to
perform their duties in health care, in accordance with
Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Ordinance, Chapter 4 § 2 and
Chapter 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40.

Report on the supervisory matter
The Data Inspectorate initiated supervision by letter on March 22, 2019 and has
on site on March 27, 2019 reviewed Karolinska University Hospital
decisions on the allocation of authorizations have been preceded by a need and
risk analysis. The review has also included how Karolinska
The University Hospital assigned privileges for access to
the main journal system TakeCare, and what access options they assigned
the authorizations provide within both the framework of the internal secrecy according to ch.
the Patient Data Act, as the cohesive record keeping according to ch.
the Patient Data Act. In addition to this, the Data Inspectorate has also examined which one
documentation of access (logs) that is in the record system.
The Data Inspectorate has only examined users' access possibilities to
the medical record system, ie what care documentation the user actually has
can take part in and read. The review does not include which features
is included in the authorization, ie what the user can actually do in
the journal system (for example, issuing prescriptions, writing referrals, etc.).
Previous review of Karolinska University Hospital's eligibility management
The Data Inspectorate has previously carried out an inspection regarding Karolinska
The University Hospital's eligibility management, etc. By the Data Inspectorate
decision with registration number 920-2012, announced on 26 August 2013, appears
that Karolinska University Hospital i.a. was instructed to carry out a needs and risk analysis as a basis for allocating authorizations in TakeCare. With

Due to the decision, Karolinska University Hospital submitted one
written answer on 18 December 2013. The answer states, among other things. to Karolinska
The University Hospital had begun work on developing an action plan
and a needs and risk analysis.
What has emerged in the case
Karolinska University Hospital has mainly stated the following.
Personal data manager
Karolinska University Hospital is a separate authority within the Region
Stockholm. The board of Karolinska University Hospital is
personal data controller for the processing of personal data that
Karolinska University Hospital performs in the main medical record system TakeCare.
Organisation
The care at Karolinska University Hospital is organized from the outside
medical thematic areas and a number of functions that bring together competencies.
Wards, receptions and day care are organized according to themes.
Each theme is divided into a number of patient areas, which gather similarities
patient flows. Function is an area of competence that runs across
teman. A function assists with skills and resources, which are used in
many different patient groups and thus in several themes. There is a
patient area manager and a function area manager for each area.
Journal system
Karolinska University Hospital uses TakeCare as
main journal system, and participates in TakeCare's cohesive system
record keeping.
Karolinska University Hospital manages TakeCare, and has
signed the agreement with the supplier. Karolinska University Hospital has
thus a large number of personal data assistant and sub-assistant agreements with
other care providers.
There is both a regional and a local organization for TakeCare. The
the regional organization consists of a management group (steering group), which
in addition to Karolinska University Hospital consists of representatives of six
other care providers.

Users and patients
Karolinska University Hospital has almost 16,000 employees in total. The number
users in the TakeCare journal system who are employed by Karolinska
The University Hospital has 12,285 members, of which 1,328 are users
inactive. At the time of the inspection, there were thus 10,957 active users.
A user account is automatically deactivated if no login has taken place on 60
days.
The TakeCare medical record system contains medical records for approximately 3 million patients.
Of these, 1,970,000 patient records are registered on, and de facto patients
at, Karolinska University Hospital.
The cohesive record keeping in TakeCare comprises approximately 200-400
healthcare providers. It is today possible to search for all social security numbers available
and TakeCare. However, there are discussions regionally about limiting in some cases
the ability to search for information to a limited number of patients, to
example patients in a particular accommodation.
Internal secrecy
Needs and risk analysis
Karolinska University Hospital can not submit with any performed
needs and risk analysis for TakeCare. It is the respective patient area and
functional area manager who will implement and document needs and
risk analyzes before granting authorizations. However, it is investigated regularly
what needs there are and what competencies employees should be assigned,
for example in new hires. The template for needs and risk analyzes that
are in Karolinska University Hospital's guidelines are not met
regularly.
Karolinska University Hospital can not answer about the work that began
following the Data Inspectorate's previous supervisory decision of 26 August 2013
resulted in a needs and risk analysis for TakeCare.
After the inspection, Karolinska University Hospital has begun work
to ensure that needs and risk analyzes are carried out throughout
the organization. Among other things, a needs and risk analysis has been carried out for
the function Perioperative Medicine and Intensive Care in accordance with Karolinska
The University Hospital's guidelines.

Authorization of access to personal data about patients
There are about 40 authorization profiles in TakeCare that contain features
such as "reading recipes". Of these, 26 are so-called reading functions. There are, among other things, two eligibility profiles for nurses,
where what distinguishes the profiles is that one has automated login.
This means that login takes place automatically at the care unit you belong to
one authorization profile, but not for the other. Also for doctors available
there are two authorization profiles. What distinguishes the profiles is that one has
access to a so-called emergency room. As a user, you can have several different ones
eligibility profiles, but not exceeding five. For example, a drug candidate may have
have been assigned permissions from several different devices. The staff bends in
such cases themselves in the journal filter in TakeCare, which means that they do one
active choice to take part in the patient's information on different devices. About one
users tick the option "all devices" so no further active is needed
choice to access patient information from all devices. Even if it
If there are different authorization profiles, Karolinska states that the users “have
access to all patients in TakeCare ”.
All accounts are individual, ie there is no account like several
users can use (group account).
In the governing document "Decision on allocation of eligibility" from 2015 (latest
updated 23 October 2018) 2 a general description of the regulations is given
and the conditions for assigning authorizations. It also contains one
description of an approach to conducting a needs and risk analysis,
based on the user's need to have access to personal data about
patients in their work and refers to the allocation of eligibility profile. In the guideline
further reminds of certain relevant issues. It is also stated that some
of the examples do not match the eligibility profiles available.
After the inspection, Karolinska University Hospital performed a needs and
risk analysis for the function Perioperative Medicine and Intensive Care. In this
states that the risks to be considered are those that arise if employees
within the business do not have access to relevant information, as well as risks
related to too broad or generous access to patient information.

The guideline "Allocation of authorizations" has been developed by lawyers and established by
the chief physician in the field of quality and patient safety.

Access to the Stockholm County healthcare area's personal data about patients
During the inspection, it emerged that users at Karolinska
The University Hospital has access to information about patients within
Stockholm County Healthcare Area (SLSO). According to Karolinska
The University Hospital is due to the fact that Karolinska University Hospital
and SLSO are listed as "one and the same" care unit in TakeCare. This means that
users at Karolinska University Hospital technically have access
also to data on patients at SLSO in the field of internal confidentiality, and vice
versa.
As for the background and motives for Karolinska University Hospital
and SLSO is listed as a care unit in TakeCare, Karolinska has
The University Hospital referred to an enforcement decision dated 2010-01
and a minutes of board meetings. The minutes state that
The county council director in the enforcement decision has stated that Stockholm
läns landstings (SLL) administrations that provide health and medical care belong to
the care provider SLL and that this means that Karolinska University Hospital
and SLSO, for the time being, shall remain unchanged as one and the same
care providers in TakeCare.
Coherent record keeping
Needs and risk analysis
No needs and risk analysis has been performed before the staff has
granted access to other care providers' care documentation within the framework of
coherent record keeping.
Authorization of access to personal data about patients
Users at Karolinska University Hospital have access to others
caregivers' data on patients in TakeCare within the framework of
coherent record keeping. Access is prepared based on the patient, and requires
patient consent. When searching for a patient, the caregivers are shown as
the patient previously sought care from. This gives an indication that it can
is information about the patient at another healthcare provider. The information
can be important in, for example, prescribing drugs. By doing one
active selection and clicking on a specific device can be accessed
the information.

There is a decision from the Stockholm Region that every care provider chooses
to use the journal system TakeCare must also be included in
coherent record keeping.
Karolinska University Hospital has a governing document “Access to
patient record, guideline ”, which applies from 17 August 20183. The guideline
contains a general description of the regulations and states them
the conditions for taking part in the care documentation in TakeCare in some
situations.
Technical restrictions in TakeCare regarding access to
personal data about patients
The technical limitations regarding users' accessibility such as
used by Karolinska University Hospital concerns so-called protected units
and TakeCare. There are currently six such devices, among others
ANNOVA, the SESAM reception and the child protection team.
With regard to the protected care units, it is not possible to limit
competencies at the individual level, but on the other hand, access to
medical records regarding these patients are limited to a defined one
user group. The protected units are not visible when held together
record keeping and they are also not included in the standard profile role in the record filter.
Decisions on protected units have been preceded by an assessment based on both
a patient safety and an integrity perspective. Protected care units
is used today only to a limited extent. This because one more
extensive use would pose significant patient safety risks.
Karolinska University Hospital has stated in a supplementary statement
following.
Technical restrictions regarding the access of individual executives:
The electronic record system TakeCare enables restriction of access by each
care unit can control what information each user group (usually occupational group)
at the device can see and what each user group can do. The care unit can continue
control what information other user groups at other care units can see respectively
do. As TakeCare is configured today, however, only control is enabled

The guideline "access to patient records, guideline" has been developed by lawyers and established by
the chief physician in the field of quality and patient safety.

user group level. Any possibility of technical limitation for individual executives
access possibilities do not exist. This applies both within the so-called internal secrecy as within
the framework for access through coherent record keeping. Regarding the hospital's so-called protected
care units, it is also not possible to limit qualifications at the individual level, but it is possible
access to medical records regarding these patients is limited to a defined one
user group.
The possibility for a care provider to opt out of access to the other care providers

Following a decision from the Stockholm Region, every care provider who chooses to use it must
The TakeCare record system is also part of cohesive record keeping. This means that a
caregivers cannot restrict other caregivers' access to their own care documentation.
The individual care provider, on the other hand, can control its users' access to information in it
coherent record keeping. The TakeCare journal system offers features that provide
the ability of the caregiver to limit the competence of its users in such a way that they only
has access to journal entries from, for example, a specially specified group with others
healthcare providers. To illustrate this, Karolinska University has referred to a screenshot,
which shows eligibility per care provider.

From the screenshot it can be read that it is possible to control at unit level
the competence of a unit's users in relation to other care providers
devices by setting them to "see document" - or "do not see"
documents ”lists. The latter list shows that it is possible to block
units at other care providers. However, it does not appear that the function exists per
caregiver, without having to block all units of the caregiver in question
if you want to block a care provider.
Documentation of access (logs)
Karolinska University Hospital has displayed various logs and stated in
essentially the following.
There are two different types of logs, in-depth logs and targeted logs.
In-depth log information can be requested on either user
(the employee) or on the patient. A targeted log information can be requested by
for example, a patient.
A screenshot showing the documentation in the logs shows the following
information is registered in the log; patient, status, time, user, system,
performed server calls (action) and from which care unit the action was performed.

Justification of the decision
Applicable rules
The Data Protection Regulation is the primary source of law
The Data Protection Regulation, often abbreviated GDPR, was introduced on 25 May 2018 and
is the primary legal regulation in the processing of personal data. This
also applies to health care.
The basic principles for the processing of personal data are set out in
Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation. A basic principle is the requirement
security pursuant to Article 5 (1) (f), which states that personal data shall be processed
in a way that ensures appropriate security for personal data,
including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized treatment and against loss;
destruction or damage by accident, using appropriate
technical or organizational measures.
Article 5 (2) states the so-called liability, ie
the person responsible for personal data must be responsible for and be able to show that they
the basic principles of paragraph 1 are complied with.
Article 24 deals with the responsibility of the controller. Of Article 24 (1)
it appears that the person responsible for personal data is responsible for implementing appropriate
technical and organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that
the processing is performed in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. The measures shall
carried out taking into account the nature, scope, context of the treatment
and purposes and the risks, of varying degrees of probability and severity, for
freedoms and rights of natural persons. The measures must be reviewed and updated
if necessary.
Article 32 regulates the security of the processing. According to paragraph 1
the personal data controller and the personal data assistant shall take into account
of the latest developments, implementation costs and treatment
nature, scope, context and purpose as well as the risks, of varying
probability and seriousness, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons
take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a
level of safety appropriate to the risk (…). According to paragraph 2,
when assessing the appropriate level of safety, special consideration is given to the risks
which the treatment entails, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction,

Page 11 of 28

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-3839

loss or alteration or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to
the personal data transferred, stored or otherwise processed.
Recital 75 states that in assessing the risk to natural persons
rights and freedoms, various factors must be taken into account. Among other things mentioned
personal data covered by professional secrecy, health data or
sexual life, if the processing of personal data concerning vulnerable physical persons takes place
persons, especially children, or if the treatment involves a large number
personal data and applies to a large number of registered persons.
Furthermore, it follows from recital 76 that the likelihood and seriousness of the risk for it
data subjects' rights and freedoms should be determined on the basis of processing
nature, scope, context and purpose. The risk should be evaluated on
on the basis of an objective assessment, which determines whether
the data processing involves a risk or a high risk.
Recitals 39 and 83 also contain writings that provide guidance on it
the meaning of the Data Protection Regulation's requirements for security in
Processing of personal data.
The Data Protection Regulation and the relationship with complementary national
provisions
According to Article 5 (1) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation, personal data must:
treated in a lawful manner. In order for the treatment to be considered legal, it is required
legal basis, provided that at least one of the conditions of Article 6 (1) is met.
The provision of health care is one such task of general
interest referred to in Article 6 (1) (e).
In health care, the legal bases can also be legal
obligation in Article 6 (1) (c) and the exercise of authority under Article 6 (1) (e)
updated.
When it comes to the legal bases legal obligation, in general
interest or exercise of authority by the Member States, in accordance with Article
6.2, maintain or introduce more specific provisions for adaptation
the application of the provisions of the Regulation to national circumstances.
National law may lay down specific requirements for the processing of data
and other measures to ensure legal and fair treatment. But
there is not only one possibility to introduce national rules but also one

DI-2019-3839

duty; Article 6 (3) states that the basis for the treatment referred to in
paragraph 1 (c) and (e) shall be determined in accordance with Union law or
national law of the Member States. The legal basis may also include
specific provisions to adapt the application of the provisions of
the Data Protection Regulation. Union law or the national law of the Member States
law must fulfill an objective of general interest and be proportionate to it
legitimate goals pursued.
Article 9 states that the treatment of specific categories of
personal data (so-called sensitive personal data) is prohibited. Sensitive
personal data includes data on health. Article 9 (2) states
except when sensitive personal data may still be processed.
Article 9 (2) (h) states that the processing of sensitive personal data may be repeated
the treatment is necessary for reasons related to, among other things
the provision of health care on the basis of Union law or
national law of the Member States or in accordance with agreements with professionals in
the field of health and provided that the conditions and protective measures provided for in
referred to in paragraph 3 are met. Article 9 (3) requires a regulated duty of confidentiality.
This means that both the legal bases of general interest,
exercise of authority and legal obligation in the treatment of the vulnerable
personal data under the derogation in Article 9 (2) (h)
supplementary rules.
Supplementary national regulations
In the case of Sweden, both the basis for the treatment and those
special conditions for the processing of personal data in the field of health and
healthcare regulated in the Patient Data Act (2008: 355), and
the Patient Data Ordinance (2008: 360). I 1 kap. Section 4 of the Patient Data Act states that
the law complements the data protection regulation.
The purpose of the Patient Data Act is to provide information in health and
healthcare must be organized so that it meets patient safety and
good quality and promotes cost efficiency. Its purpose is also to
personal data shall be designed and otherwise processed so that patients and
the privacy of other data subjects is respected. In addition, must be documented
personal data is handled and stored so that unauthorized persons do not have access to it
them (Chapter 1, Section 2 of the Patient Data Act).

According to ch. Section 6 of the Patient Data Act is a care provider responsible for personal data
for the processing of personal data carried out by the care provider. In a region
and one municipality is each authority that conducts health and medical care
personal data controller for the processing of personal data that
the authority performs.
The supplementary provisions in the Patient Data Act aim to:
take care of both privacy protection and patient safety. The legislator has
thus through the regulation made a balance as to how
the information must be processed to meet both the requirements for patient safety
as the right to privacy in the processing of personal data.
The National Board of Health and Welfare has, with the support of the Patient Data Ordinance, issued regulations
and general advice on record keeping and processing of personal data in
health care (HSLF-FS 2016: 40). The regulations constitute such
supplementary rules, which shall be applied in the care provider's treatment of
personal data in health care.
National provisions that supplement the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation
security can be found in Chapters 4 and 6. the Patient Data Act and Chapters 3 and 4 HSLF-FS
2016: 40.
Requirement to do needs and risk analysis
According to ch. 4, the care provider must § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40 make a needs and
risk analysis, before the allocation of authorizations in the system takes place.
That both the needs and the risks are required is clear from the preparatory work
to the Patient Data Act, prop. 2007/08: 126 pp. 148-149, as follows.
Authorization for staff's electronic access to patient information shall be restricted to
what the executive needs to be able to perform his duties in health and
healthcare. This includes that authorizations should be followed up and changed or restricted accordingly
hand as changes in the tasks of the individual executive give rise to it.
The provision corresponds in principle to section 8 of the Health Care Register Act. The purpose of the provision is to
imprint the obligation on the responsible caregiver to make active and individual
eligibility assignments based on analyzes of which details are different
staff categories and different types of activities need. But it's not just needed
needs analyzes. Risk analyzes must also be done where different types of risks are taken into account, such as
may be associated with an overly availability of certain types of information.
Protected personal data that is classified, information about publicly known persons,

data from certain clinics or medical specialties are examples of categories such as
may require special risk assessments.
In general, it can be said that the more comprehensive an information system is, the greater the amount
there must be different levels of eligibility. Decisive for decisions on eligibility for e.g. various
categories of healthcare professionals for electronic access to data in
patient records should be that the authority should be limited to what the executive needs
for the purpose a good and safe patient care. A more extensive or coarse-meshed
allocation of competence should - even if it has points from the point of view of efficiency - be regarded as an unjustified dissemination of medical records within an
not accepted.
Furthermore, data should be stored in different layers so that more sensitive data require active choices or
otherwise not as easily accessible to staff as less sensitive tasks. When it
applies to staff who work with business follow-up, statistics production, central
financial administration and similar activities that are not individual-oriented, it should be
most executives have enough access to information that can only be indirectly derived
to individual patients. Electronic access to code keys, social security numbers and others
data that directly point out individual patients should be strong in this area
limited to individuals.

Internal secrecy
The provisions in ch. 4 the Patient Data Act concerns the internal secrecy, that is
say regulates how the privacy protection is to be handled within a care provider
activities and especially employees' opportunities to prepare for access to
personal data that is electronically available in a healthcare provider
organisation.
It appears from ch. Section 2 of the Patient Data Act stipulates that the care provider must decide
conditions for granting access to such data
patients who are fully or partially automated. Such authorization shall
limited to what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill theirs
tasks in health care.
Of ch. 4 § 2 HSLF-FS 2016: 40 follows that the care provider shall be responsible for each
users are assigned an individual privilege to access
personal data. The caregiver's decision on the allocation of eligibility shall
preceded by a needs and risk analysis.
Coherent record keeping
Provisions in Chapter 6 the Patient Data Act concerns cohesive record keeping,
which means that a care provider - under the conditions specified in § 2 of the same
chapter - may have direct access to personal data processed by others

Page 15 of 28

1 5 (28)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-3839

caregivers for purposes related to care documentation. The access to
information is provided by a healthcare provider making the information about a patient
which the care provider registers if the patient is available to other care providers
who participate in the coherent record keeping (see Bill 2007/08: 126 p. 247).
Of ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act follows that the provisions in Chapter 4 also applies
for authorization allocation for unified record keeping. The requirement that
the care provider must perform a needs and risk analysis before allocating
permissions in the system take place, also applies in systems for cohesion
record keeping.
Documentation of access (logs)
Of ch. 4 Section 3 of the Patient Data Act states that a care provider must ensure that
access to such data on patients kept in whole or in part
automatically documented and systematically checked.
According to ch. 4 Section 9 HSLF-FS 2016: 40, the care provider shall be responsible for that
1. the documentation of the access (logs) states which
measures taken with information on a patient,
2. it appears from the logs at which care unit or care process
measures have been taken,
3. the logs indicate the time at which the measures were taken;
4. the identity of the user and the patient is stated in the logs.

The Data Inspectorate's assessment
Responsibility of the data controller for security
As described above, the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations give the caregiver one
responsibility for information management in healthcare, such as that
carry out a needs and risk analysis before assigning authorizations in
the system happens. In public health care does not coincide
always the concept of caregiver with the personal data controller.
Of both the basic principles of Article 5 and Article 24 (1)
the Data Protection Ordinance, it appears that it is the person responsible for personal data
which shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to:
ensure and be able to demonstrate that the treatment is carried out in accordance with
the Data Protection Regulation.

DI-2019-3839

The Data Inspectorate can state that the Data Protection Ordinance in its capacity as
EU regulation is directly applicable in Swedish law and that in the regulation
indicates when supplementary regulation is or may be introduced nationally. There is
for example, space to nationally regulate who is
data controller in accordance with Article 4 of the Data Protection Regulation. It is
however, it is not possible to give deviating regulation regarding it
the responsibility of the data controller to take appropriate technical and
organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security in
relation to the risk. This means that the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations state
that it is the caregiver who must take certain measures, does not change that
the responsibility to take appropriate security measures rests with it
personal data controller according to the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate
can state that Karolinska University Hospital, in its capacity as
responsible for personal data, is responsible for taking these measures.
As previously described, Article 24 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation provides a
general requirement for the personal data controller to take appropriate technical
and organizational measures. The requirement is partly to ensure that
the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with
the Data Protection Ordinance, and that the data controller must be able to
demonstrate that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with
the Data Protection Regulation.
The security of the treatment is regulated more specifically in Article 5 (1) (f)
and Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation.
Article 32 (1) states that the appropriate measures shall be both technical and
organizational and they must ensure a level of security appropriate in
in relation to the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons which
the treatment entails. It is therefore necessary to identify the possible ones
the risks to the data subjects' rights and freedoms and assess
the probability of the risks occurring and the severity if they occur.
What is appropriate varies not only in relation to the risks but also
based on the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment. It has
thus the significance of what personal data is processed, how many
data, it is a question of how many people process the data, etc.

DI-2019-3839

The health service has a great need for information in its operations. The
It is therefore natural that the possibilities of digitalisation are utilized as much as
possible in healthcare. Since the Patient Data Act was introduced, a lot
extensive digitization has taken place in healthcare. Both the data collections
size as the number of people sharing information with each other has increased
substantially. At the same time, this increase means that the demands on it increase
personal data controller, as the assessment of what is an appropriate
safety is affected by the extent of the treatment.
It is also a question of sensitive personal data. The information also concerns
people who are in a situation of dependence when they are in need of care.
It is also often a question of a lot of personal information about each of these
people and the data may over time be processed by very
many people in healthcare. All in all, this places great demands on it
personal data controller.
The data processed must be protected against actors outside as well
the business as against unauthorized access from within the business. It appears
of Article 32 (2) that the data controller, in assessing the appropriate
level of security, in particular to take into account the risks of unintentional or illegal
destruction, loss or for unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access. In order to
be able to know what is an unauthorized access it must
personal data controllers must be clear about what an authorized access is.
Needs and risk analysis
I 4 kap. Section 2 of the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations (HSLF-FS 2016: 40) which supplement
the Patient Data Act, it is stated that the care provider must make a needs and
risk analysis before the allocation of authorizations in the system takes place. This means that
national law prescribes requirements for an appropriate organizational measure that shall:
taken before the allocation of permissions to the journal system takes place.
A needs and risk analysis must include an analysis of the needs and a
analysis of the risks from an integrity perspective that may be associated
with an overly allotment of access to patient data.
Both the needs and the risks must be assessed on the basis of the information provided
need to be addressed in the business, what processes it is a matter of and
what risks to the privacy of the individual exist.

Page 18 of 28

1 8 (28)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-3839

The assessments of the risks need to be made on the basis of organizational level, there
for example, a certain business part or task may be more
more sensitive to privacy than another, but also based on the individual level, if any
the question of special circumstances that need to be taken into account, such as
that it is a question of protected personal data, publicly known persons or
otherwise particularly vulnerable persons. The size of the system also affects
the risk assessment. The preparatory work for the Patient Data Act shows that the more
comprehensive an information system is, the greater the variety
eligibility levels must exist. (Prop. 2007/08: 126 p. 149). It is thus
the question of a strategic analysis at the strategic level, which should provide one
authorization structure that is adapted to the business and this must be maintained
updated.
In summary, the regulation requires that the risk analysis identify


different categories of data (eg health data),



categories of data subjects (eg vulnerable natural persons and
children), or



the scope (eg number of personal data and registered)



negative consequences for data subjects (eg damages,
significant social or economic disadvantage, deprivation of rights
and freedoms)

and how they affect the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons
Processing of personal data. This applies to both internal secrecy
as in coherent record keeping.
The risk analysis must also include special risk assessments, for example
based on whether there is protected personal data that is
classified, information on public figures, information from
certain clinics or medical specialties (Bill 2007/08: 126 p. 148149).
The risk analysis must also include an assessment of how probable and serious
the risk to the data subjects' rights and freedoms is and in any case determined
whether it is a risk or a high risk (recital 76).
It is thus through the needs and risk analysis that it
personal data controller finds out who needs access, which

Page 19 of 27

1 9 (28)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-3839

information the accessibility shall include, at what times and at what
context access is needed, while analyzing the risks to it
the freedoms and rights of the individual that the treatment may lead to. The result should
then lead to the technical and organizational measures needed to
ensure that no access other than that of need and
the risk analysis shows that it is justified to be able to do so.
When a needs and risk analysis is missing prior to the allocation of eligibility in
system, lacks the basis for the personal data controller on a legal
be able to assign their users a correct authorization. The
the data controller is responsible for, and shall have control over, the
personal data processing that takes place within the framework of the business. To
assign users one upon access to journal system, without this being founded
on a performed needs and risk analysis, means that the person responsible for personal data
does not have sufficient control over the personal data processing that takes place in
the journal system and also can not show that he has the control that
required.
When the Data Inspectorate has requested a needs and risk analysis
Karolinska University Hospital referred to the governing document “Decision on
eligibility allocation, guideline ”4 (eligibility allocation guidelines) and
stated that it is the respective patient area and function area manager
who must carry out and document needs and risk analyzes before
allocation of authorizations. According to Karolinska University Hospital, this is done
when allocating qualifications, for example for new hires, on a regular basis
an investigation of what the employee's need for competence also is
the template for needs and risk analyzes contained in the guideline is not filled in
regularly. Karolinska University Hospital was able at the time of
the inspection does not present a needs and risk analysis performed, but has
afterwards stated that they had begun work to ensure that the needs and
risk analyzes are performed in the business. They have also submitted a documented
"Needs and risk analysis" for the functional area Perioperative Medicine.
As stated above, in a needs and risk analysis, both the needs and
the risks are assessed on the basis of the data that need to be processed in
the business, what processes are involved and what are the risks for it
individual integrity that exists on both organizational and individual
4

"Decision on authorization allocation, guideline" which applies from 23 October 2018.

level. It is thus a question of a strategic analysis at a strategic level, which
shall provide an authorization structure that is adapted to the activities. It should
suitably result in authorization assignments but it is
not the instructions to the person assigning permissions that are the analysis.
At the time of the inspection, Karolinska University Hospital was unable to
present a needs and risk analysis. The latter submitted needs and
the risk analysis regarding the function Perioperative Medicine does not meet
the data protection provisions' requirements for such an analysis according to ch. § 2 HSLFFS 2016: 40, as it constitutes a general description of work tasks in
TakeCare for some specific occupational categories. The document contains none
analysis of what tasks employees need to be able to perform their
tasks. The document does not contain an analysis of the risks that may
be associated with an too at availability regarding various types of
personal data.
The Data Inspectorate further states that the approach described in
eligibility guidelines to analyze which eligibility
to be assigned to an individual user based on the existing ones
the eligibility profiles. These are created based on what users need
be able to do with the tasks, such as reading or writing, and not from the outside
what information about the patient the individual user needs to have
access to be able to perform their work.
The needs and risk analyzes described in Karolinska University Hospital's
eligibility guidelines are not an analysis according to the requirements of a
needs and risk analysis in accordance with the data protection regulations. Karolinska
The University Hospital has also not been able to show that the work that was started
after the previous review in 2013 resulted in the implementation of a
needs and risk analysis for TakeCare in accordance with the injunction.
The Data Inspectorate can thus state that Karolinska
The University Hospital's allocation of qualifications has not been preceded by one
necessary needs and risk analysis.
Authorization of access to personal data about
patients
As reported above, a caregiver may have a legitimate interest in having
a comprehensive processing of data on the health of individuals. Notwithstanding this shall

Page 21 of 28

2 1 (28)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-3839

access to personal data about patients may be limited to
what is needed for the individual to be able to fulfill his or her duties.
With regard to the allocation of authorization for electronic access according to ch.
§ 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act states in the preparatory work, Bill.
2007/08: 126 pp. 148-149, including that there should be different
authorization categories in the medical record system and that the authorizations shall
limited to what the user needs to give the patient a good and safe
care. It also appears that “a more extensive or coarse-meshed
allocation of competences should be considered as an unjustified dissemination of
journal information within an activity and as such should not be accepted. "
In health care, it is the person who needs the information in their work
who may be authorized to access them. This applies both within a
caregivers as between caregivers. It is, as already mentioned, through
the needs and risk analysis that the person responsible for personal data finds out who
who need access, what information the access should include, at which
times and in which contexts access is needed, and at the same time
analyzes the risks to the individual's freedoms and rights
the treatment can lead to. The result should then lead to the technical and
organizational measures needed to ensure no allocation
of eligibility provides further access opportunities than the one that needs and
the risk analysis shows is justified. An important organizational measure is to provide
instruction to those who have the authority to assign permissions on how this
should go to and what should be considered so that it, with the needs and risk analysis
as a basis, becomes a correct authorization allocation in each individual case.
In addition to Karolinska University Hospital's guideline for awarding
permissions, there is also a control document “Access to patient records,
guideline ”(guidelines on access), valid from 17 August 2018.5
However, the guidelines only provide a general description of the regulations and
describes the conditions for the allocation of authorizations and for
to take part in the care documentation in TakeCare in different situations.
The Data Inspectorate notes that even if each user de facto has
has been granted an individual authorization, the assigned authorizations have not
The guideline "access to patient records, guideline" is established by the chief physician in the area
quality and patient safety, and lawyers have participated in the development area.

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-3839

limited in a way that ensures that the user does not have
access to more personal data about patients or personal data
if more patients than he needs to perform his work. They assigned
the permissions instead mean that the user has access to basically everyone
personal data about patients in TakeCare. This is because there are only two
eligibility profiles for nurses and doctors respectively, and where the only one
that distinguishes the eligibility profiles is that one
the nurse's authorization has an automated login to that care unit
the staff belongs to and one of the doctors has access to a so-called
emergency room. The restriction that has otherwise emerged regarding
access possibilities to personal data in the record system refers to so-called
protected devices.
Against this background, the Data Inspectorate considers that, since the allocation
of qualifications not preceded by a necessary needs and risk analysis, no
there were conditions to limit assigned privileges or there was support
to determine what are justified access opportunities for executives
at Karolinska University Hospital.
That the allocation of authorizations has not been preceded by a need and
risk analysis means that Karolinska University Hospital has not analyzed
users' need for access to the data, the risks associated with that access
can entail and thus also not identified which access options
which are justified to users on the basis of such an analysis. Karolinska
The University Hospital has thus not taken appropriate organizational measures
measures, in accordance with Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation, to limit
users' access to personal data about patients in the medical record system.
This in turn has meant that there has been a risk of unauthorized access and
unjustified dissemination of personal data partly within the framework of the internal
secrecy, partly within the framework of the coherent record keeping. The number
users at Karolinska University Hospital are close to 11,000 and
TakeCare contains personal data concerning approximately 3 million patients, of which
about 2 million have been patients at Karolinska University Hospital.
In the light of the above, the Data Inspectorate can state that
Karolinska University Hospital has processed personal data in violation of
Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Regulation by:
Karolinska University Hospital has not restricted users

Page 23 of 27

2 3 (28)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-3839

permissions for accessing the TakeCare journal system to what only
is needed for the user to be able to fulfill his tasks within
health and medical care according to ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and 4
Cape. 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. This means that Karolinska University Hospital
have not taken measures to ensure and, in accordance with Article
5.2 Data Protection Regulation, be able to demonstrate appropriate security for
personal data.
Documentation of access in logs
The Data Inspectorate states that it appears from the logs in TakeCare
information about the specific patient, which user has opened
the journal, measures that have been taken, which journal entry has
opened, what time period the user has been in, all openings of
the record made on that patient during the selected time period and
time and date of last opening. According to the Data Inspectorate
assessment, this is in accordance with the requirements for documentation of
accesses in the logs set out in the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations.

Choice of intervention
Legal regulation
If there has been a violation of the Data Protection Regulation
The Data Inspectorate a number of corrective powers available under the article
58.2 a - j of the Data Protection Regulation. The supervisory authority can, among other things
instruct the person responsible for personal data to ensure that the processing takes place in
in accordance with the Regulation and if required in a specific way and within a
specific period.
It follows from Article 58 (2) of the Data Protection Ordinance that the Data Inspectorate in
in accordance with Article 83 shall impose penalty charges in addition to, or instead of,
other corrective measures referred to in Article 58 (2),
the circumstances of each individual case.
For authorities, according to Article 83 (7) of the Data Protection Regulation, national
rules state that authorities may be subject to administrative penalty fees.
According to ch. 6 Section 2 of the Data Protection Act allows for penalty fees to be decided
authorities, but to a maximum of SEK 5,000,000 or SEK 10,000,000

Page 24 of 28

2 4 (28)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-3839

depending on whether the infringement concerns articles covered by Article 83 (4)
or 83.5 of the Data Protection Regulation.
Article 83 (2) sets out the factors to be taken into account in determining whether a
administrative penalty fee shall be imposed, but also what shall affect
the size of the penalty fee. Of central importance for the assessment of
the seriousness of the infringement is its nature, severity and duration. If
in the case of a minor infringement, the supervisory authority may, according to reasons
148 of the Data Protection Regulation, issue a reprimand instead of imposing one
penalty fee.
Order
As mentioned, the health service has a great need for information in its
operations and in recent years has a very extensive digitization
occurred in healthcare. Both the size of the data collections and how many
sharing information with each other has increased significantly. This increases the demands on
the personal data controller, as the assessment of what is an appropriate
safety is affected by the extent of the treatment.
In health care, this means even greater responsibility for it
personal data controller to protect the data from unauthorized access,
among other things by having an authorization allocation that is atomized. The
It is therefore essential that there is a real analysis of the needs based on different
businesses and various executives. Equally important is that it happens one
actual analysis of the risks that may arise from an integrity perspective
in the event of an excessive allocation of access rights. Based on this analysis
shall then restrict the access of the individual executive. This
eligibility must then be followed up and changed or gradually reduced
as changes in the tasks of the individual executive result
reason for it.
The Data Inspectorate's inspection has shown that Karolinska University Hospital does not
has taken appropriate security measures to provide protection to
the personal data in the record system by Karolinska
The university hospital in its capacity as personal data controller did not comply with the requirements
which is set in the Patient Data Act and the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations. Karolinska
The University Hospital has thereby failed to comply with the requirements of Article 5 (1) (f)
and Article 32 (1) and (2) of the Data Protection Regulation. The omission includes

Page 25 of 28

2 5 (28)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-3839

both the internal secrecy according to ch. the Patient Data Act as it
coherent record keeping according to ch. 6 the Patient Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate therefore submits, with the support of 58.2 d i
the Data Protection Ordinance, Karolinska University Hospital to ensure that
The required needs and risk analysis for the TakeCare medical record system is carried out
within the framework of both internal confidentiality and within it
coherent record keeping. The needs and risk analysis must be documented.
Karolinska University Hospital will continue, with the support of needs and
risk analysis, assign each user individual privileges to access
personal data that is limited to only what is needed for it
individuals must be able to fulfill their duties in health care.
Penalty fee
The Data Inspectorate can state that the violations are fundamentally related
Karolinska University Hospital's obligation to take appropriate
security measures to provide protection of personal data according to
the Data Protection Regulation.
In this case, it is a matter of very large data collections with sensitive
personal data and extensive powers. The caregiver needs to be involved
necessity to have a comprehensive processing of data on the health of individuals.
However, it must not be unrestricted but should be based on what individual
employees need to be able to perform their tasks. The Data Inspectorate
notes that this is information that includes direct identification
by the individual through name, contact information and social security number,
information about health, but that it may also be about other private
information about, for example, family relationships, sexual life and lifestyle. Patients
is dependent on receiving care and is thus in a vulnerable situation. The data
nature, scope and patients' dependence give caregivers a
special responsibility to ensure patients' right to adequate protection for their
personal data.
Additional aggravating circumstances are the treatment of
patient information in the main medical record system belongs to the core of a healthcare provider
activities, that the treatment includes many patients and the possibility of
access refers to a large proportion of employees. In this case, it's about
about 2,000,000 patients in the field of internal confidentiality and
about another 1,000,000 patients within the cohesive framework

Page 26 of 28

2 6 (28)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-3839

record keeping. There are only six so-called protected units there
the data is not accessible to users outside these devices.
The Data Inspectorate can also state that Karolinska
The University Hospital did not follow the Data Inspectorate's previous injunction from
on 26 August 2013 to carry out a needs and risk analysis which
basis for allocation of authorizations in accordance with the then requirement in ch. 6
§ second paragraph second sentence SOSFS 2008: 14, which corresponds to the current one
provision in ch. 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40. This is an aggravating circumstance
circumstance, in accordance with Article 83 (2) (e) of the Data Protection Regulation.
The shortcomings that have now been established have thus been known to Karolinska
The university hospital for several years, which means that the action took place
intentionally and thus is considered more serious.
In determining the seriousness of the infringements, it can also be stated that
the infringements also cover the basic principles set out in Article 5 (i)
the Data Protection Regulation, which belongs to the categories of more serious
infringements which may give rise to a higher penalty under Article 83 (5) (i)
the Data Protection Regulation.
Taken together, these factors mean that the infringements are not to be assessed
as minor violations without violations that should lead to a
administrative penalty fee.
The Data Inspectorate considers that these violations are closely related to
each other. That assessment is based on the need and risk analysis
form the basis for the allocation of the authorizations. The Data Inspectorate
therefore considers that these infringements are so closely linked
that they constitute interconnected data processing within the meaning of Article 83 (3) (i)
the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Inspectorate therefore decides on a joint
penalty fee for these infringements.
The administrative penalty fee shall be effective, proportionate and
deterrent. This means that the amount must be determined so that it
the administrative penalty fee leads to correction, that it provides a preventive
effect and that it is also proportional in relation to both current
violations as to the ability of the supervised entity to pay.

The maximum amount for the penalty fee in this case is SEK 10 million
according to ch. 6 Section 2 of the Act (2018: 218) with supplementary provisions to the EU
data protection regulation.
In view of the seriousness of the infringements and that the administrative
the penalty fee must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive
the Data Inspectorate determines the administrative sanction fee for
Karolinska University Hospital to SEK 4,000,000 (four million).
