caused a longer processing time and that information and a copy of
the complainant's personal data according to Article 15 was only sent on 18 June 2019. The company
has quickly answered the complainant's follow-up questions about the company's personal data processing
which the appellant was satisfied with.

The personal data controller is obliged to provide, to anyone who requests it
notification of personal data relating to the applicant being processed or not. treated
such data, the personal data controller, in accordance with Article 15 i

copy of the personal data processed by the data controller.

According to Article 12.3, a request for access must be handled without undue delay and
in any case no later than one month after the request is received. The deadline if

IMY's assessment

Has there been a breach of the data protection regulation?

Complaint 1 (Annex 1 from Austria with national reference number: D130.247)

Regarding the first complaint, the IMY notes that the complainant, in accordance with
article 15 of the data protection regulation, provided with information and a copy of them
personal data that is processed. However, the right of access was only granted after more than
five months from the submission of the first request. The request has therefore not
handled without undue delay and within the stipulated time limit in Article 12.3 and
nor has the complainant been informed of the delay.

What the company stated that they handle a large amount of inquiry cases according to
the data protection regulation and that follow-up questions are answered quickly does not cause anyone
different assessment regarding the delay and that it was therefore a question of one
violation of Article 12.3 regarding Complaint 1.

Complaint 2 (Annex 2 from Germany with national reference number: LDA-1085.1-
13373/19-F)

Regarding the second complaint, the IMY notes that the complainant, in accordance with
article 15, provided with information and a copy of the personal data that
treated. The information was provided without undue delay. After the complainant
pointed out that he had not received the dispatch, the company requested alternative contact details.
Against this background, IMY considers that the company has not been obliged to take any measures
further action on that request.

Choice of intervention
From article 58.2 i and article 83.2 it appears that IMY has the authority to impose
administrative penalty fees in accordance with Article 83. Depending on
the circumstances of the individual case, administrative penalty fees must be imposed
in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58.2, such as
injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83.2 states which factors must
taken into account when deciding whether administrative penalty charges are to be imposed and at
determining the size of the fee. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY gets
as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty charge issue one
reprimand according to article 58.2 b. Consideration must be given to aggravating and mitigating circumstances
circumstances of the case, such as the nature, severity and duration of the infringement
as well as previous violations of relevance.

IMY finds in an overall assessment of the circumstances that, regarding complaints
1, is a minor violation in the sense referred to in recital 148 and that
Klarna Bank AB must therefore be given a reprimand according to article 58.2 b for the found
the violation.
