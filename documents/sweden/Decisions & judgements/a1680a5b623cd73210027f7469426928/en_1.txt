The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-5660

Reason for the decision
Applicable regulations
Debt collection operations must be conducted in accordance with good debt collection practice (Section 4 of the Debt Collection Act).
What is good debt collection procedure is stated in Sections 5–11 of the Debt Collection Act,
The Swedish Data Inspectorate's general advice "Application of the Debt Collection Act" and
The Data Inspectorate's practice in debt collection issues.
Design of debt collection claims
Applicable provisions, etc.
Debt collection claims must state the time within which the debtor has to pay voluntarily
or file an objection to the claim (Section 5, third paragraph, of the Debt Collection Act). The
means that debt collection claims must contain information about the possibility of
object to the claim.
A debt collection claim should be titled "Debt collection claim" to make it clear
the debtor that it is such a requirement (Datainspektionen's general advice
Application of the Debt Collection Act page 22).
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
Of the example of debt collection claims that the Data Inspectorate has read in one
complaint, there is a lack of content about the possibility to object
the claim, as well as the heading “Debt collection claim”.
The company stated that debt collection requirements (according to the template KA04) already in April 2018 have
adjusted so that it is heading Debt collection claims. At the inspection
was noted, however, that there was still a lack of information about
the possibility of objecting to the claim.
The company has subsequently submitted an adjusted debt collection requirement (KA04)
entitled "Debt collection claim". The adjusted debt collection requirement now contains
the following text, “Do you have any objections to the claim? Contact us within
eight days after the date of printing of this letter. "
The Data Inspectorate states that part of Intrum's debt collection requirements
lacked information on the possibility of objecting to the claim. The company has
thereby violated section 5 of the Debt Collection Act.

The Data Inspectorate

The current demand letters have lacked the heading "Debt collection requirements" and were initiated
with the following text “We see that you always pay your invoices on time and
therefore, we wonder if you missed this payment? ” To the debtor
To understand that this is a debt collection claim, it is important that the letter
heading and design in general is clear. Then the current debt collection requirements
during a period of time completely devoid of heading, they can not be considered to have given
the debtor adequate guidance as to what action he or she has received.
This is especially in light of other shortcomings in the design of the letter.
The Data Inspectorate can thus establish that the Company has acted in violation of good
debt collection, and thereby section 4 of the Debt Collection Act.
The Data Inspectorate further states that Intrum has now corrected the incorrect one
the design of the debt collection claim and that there is therefore no longer any reason
to take any further action.
Digitized mailings of debt collection claims
Applicable provisions, etc.
Legal action in connection with the claim may not be taken until the debtor
requirements referred to in section 5 of the Debt Collection Act and the specified time has expired (Section 6
debt collection law). With reference to section 5, it is meant that the claim must be presented
in writing and have a certain content.
In the preparatory work for the Debt Collection Act, it is stated that the provision that the debtor must have
requirements do not imply anything other than that the creditor or his representative must have
have taken reasonable measures to ensure that the debtor receives the claim. Normally should
it should be sufficient that the demand letter is sent by post under the debtor's usual
address (prop. 1974: 42).
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
Intrum sends debt collection claims by post or via the Kivra digital mailbox. At
In the inspection, Intrum mainly stated the following about a new routine to send
collection requirements digitally. The company has since February this year sent out debt collection claims
also via the digital mailbox Kivra. The deadline to pay voluntarily or
object to the requirement is the same as the requirements sent by physical mail.
When a debt collection claim is sent via Kivra, the debt collection claim is available in
the recipient's mailbox in Kivra the same day. In that the debtor has chosen to

join the digital mailbox and thereby have undertaken to monitor
it as if it were their population registration address, the company considers that they
by sending the debt collection claim via Kivra to the debtor
the debt collection claim. A debtor who no longer wants to receive the debt collection claim via Kivra can
unsubscribe either via Kivra or via Intrum. Intrum then announces its
print supplier and sends a collection claim by post with a new deadline for
payment or objection. About a quarter of the debt collection claims sent
out to debtors goes via Kivra.
By joining the Kivra digital mailbox, companies and
authorities, instead of sending letters in paper form by physical mail, choose
to send letters as electronic mail to individuals and companies
who has registered an account with Kivra.
The Data Inspectorate states that there is no requirement in section 5 of the Debt Collection Act
that a debt collection claim in this case must be sent to the debtor in paper form.
The Data Inspectorate believes that the Kivra digital mailbox is one such place
which can be equated with the debtor's address if the debtor has voluntarily joined
to Kivra and not notified Intrum or Kivra of the digital mailbox
may not be used for sending Intrum's debt collection claims. The Data Inspectorate
notes that mailing of a debt collection claim via the digital mailbox Kivra
in the circumstances of the case may be considered served
the debtor in accordance with section 6 of the Debt Collection Act. There is thus nothing formal
obstacles for Intrum to introduce a routine that means that the debt collection claim is sent to
the debtor via a digital mailbox, as long as the requirement complies with Sections 5 and 6
the Debt Collection Act and good debt collection in general.
Other
What has emerged during the inspection in general does not cause any
comments from the Data Inspectorate.
