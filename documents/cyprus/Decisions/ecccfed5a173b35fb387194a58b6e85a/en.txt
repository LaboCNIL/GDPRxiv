  REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS E P I T R O P O S No. Fax: 11.17.001.009.242 OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER FOR THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA DECISION Complaint for breach of personal data Mr. XXX at XXX General Hospital Facts I refer to the complaint submitted to my Office regarding the above matter and according to the information before me I find a violation of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons against the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (hereinafter the "Regulation"), by the State Health Services Organization ( henceforth "OKYPY"). A. 2.1. A complaint was submitted to my Office on November 1, 2021, by Ms. XXX (hereinafter the "complainant") against OKYpY. 2.2. The complaint in question mentions, among other things, the following: (a) The complainant is XXX at the Medical Services of G.N. XXX. (b) The complainant claims that, while she was absent on sick leave, she was informed that Mr. XXX, who is XXX OKYPY in the same Department of the G.N. XXX, emptied the drawers of the complainant's desk, and then placed her documents and personal belongings in cardboard boxes, without informing her first. (c) In addition, the complainant states that Ms. XXX, who is XXX OKYPY in G.N. XXX, gave instructions to an Information Technology Officer, how to replace her computer tower with a computer tower belonging to another OKYpY employee. (d) Further, in her drawers, the complainant had the personal medical records of herself, her husband and her children. (e) Mr. XXX informed Ms. XXX, who in turn notified the Administrative Officer, Mr. XXX, and then the File Manager, Mr. XXX, and then the Secretarial Officer, Ms. XXX. The files in question were returned to the Archive, without any information and in the absence of the complainant. f) The complainant maintains that the personal medical files have always been kept in the staff drawers inside the hospital, for easy access as well as for protection, because the appropriate conditions and conditions for their safe storage do not prevail in the file archive. Iasonos 1, 2nd floor, 1082 NICOSIA / PO Box 23378, 1682 NICOSIA. Tel: 22818456, Fax: 22304565 E-mail: commissioner@dataprotection.gov.cy, Website: http://www.dataprotection.gov.cy (g) To strengthen her position, the complainant presented to my Office a relevant circular dated October 25, 2021 with no. lens 05.25.063, which the Patient Registry Manager communicated to the staff of G.N. XXX, after the incident, so as to "... justify their action, ... thus showing that they knew that the staff held personal files and also that it was not prohibited". 2.3. On November 05, 2021, based on my duty to examine complaints, pursuant to Article 57(1)(f) of the Regulation, an electronic message was sent on my behalf to the Data Protection Officer (hereinafter the "DPO") of OKYpY, with which was informed of the complaint in question and was called upon to inform me, until November 25, 2021, regarding the positions on the allegations of the complainant. More specifically, the OKYPY was requested, by the above date, to: (a) submit its positions, in relation to the incident in question, (b) inform my Office about the reasons why the personal belongings and the contents of the drawers of the complainant's office were moved in her absence and without notification, (c) inform my Office of the reasons why the staff of G.N. XXX had in his possession the physical medical files of himself and their relatives, and (d) inform my Office of the procedure followed, regarding the movement and/or clearing of the contents of the staff desk drawers. 2.4. On November 24, 2021, my Office received via e-mail a reply letter, from the DPA of OKYPY, in which, among other things, the following are mentioned: 2.4.1. The Directorate of G.N. XXX, through XXX, Mrs. XXX, had instructed the complainant to move and return to her duties at the Ministry of Health, after her sick leave. The complainant was aware of this particular move when she would return from her sick leave. 2.4.2. Despite the instructions to carry out the transfer in question, after the return of the complainant, another employee of OKYPY, on his own initiative, vacated the office of the complainant, in her absence and while she was on sick leave. The complainant was informed of the incident by other colleagues. 2.4.3. During the process of moving the complainant's personal belongings from her drawers, to which there was free access, it became apparent that she had in her possession original medical records of herself and her family members. The medical files in question were subsequently returned to the OKYpY file, where the relevant re-filing took place. 2.4.4. The DPO of OKYPY adds that, even if there was a need for immediate movement of the complainant's belongings and she could not be present, "the movement was poorly executed without first notifying the complainant of this intention and giving her the opportunity to authorize another person to be present during the moving process'. 2.4.5. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, in summary, admits that: 2 (a) The staff of OKYpY is not sufficiently informed and aware of matters concerning personal data. (b) OKYpY recognizes that the absence of written procedures for moving objects and/or electronic personnel data and clearing the contents of drawers entails risks. In general, the practice followed is for the liquidation to take place in the presence of the subject or his authorized representative. However, in this particular case this practice was not followed. (c) The possession of original medical files by the staff is a violation of the Law on the Establishment of the State Health Services Organization (Law 73(I)/2017) and the Law on the Entitlement and Protection of Patients' Rights (Law 1(I) /2005), which provide that the competent health service provider (G.N. XXX) must keep medical records, which show the course of the patient's treatment. (d) It is the position of OKYpY that the withholding of the medical file by the patient himself "in addition to being illegal, creates a multitude of problems for the management of the Organization, but also in the management of incidents that may arise and concern the subject". Anyone wishing to obtain a copy of their medical record may do so through the appropriate process and upon request. (e) The Ministry of Internal Affairs emphasizes that the complainant's possession of the physical medical files in question is unjustified and violates the instructions of the OKYPY to the staff. (f) The Directorate of G.N. XXX, recognizing the problem, repeatedly called the staff, with internal circulars, to return to the Archives, medical records that he may have in his possession. (g) The inability to identify the absence of the medical files from the Archive reveals the Organization's inability to handle similar incidents, a fact which is recognized by the Directorate. (h) The absence of a process for managing the Medical File reveals the inability to properly process the medical files within (but also outside) the Organization, which however does not reduce the consequences of the illegal possession of the medical files by the complainant. (i) Regarding the movement of the complainant's belongings, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that it was done in the context of her own movement to her duties at the Ministry of Health. However, they were moved without reason and in her absence and without prior notification. 2.4.6. After the incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in collaboration with the management of OKYpY, plan, among other things, to take the following actions: (a) Training of all staff in matters concerning the Regulation and the proper management of personal data. (b) Preparation of a procedure for managing and handling the Medical file inside and outside the hospitals, so as to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents, whether it concerns an employee or a patient visiting the health units / services of the OKYpY. (c) Preparation by OKYpY and adoption of personnel movement / transfer procedures, where clear reference will be made to the method of movement / departure of personnel, personal data and work equipment (computers, electronic devices, etc.). 2.5. On November 05, 2021, my Office sent an email to the complainant, raising questions about the custody of the originals 3 Legal framework medical files in the drawers of her office, as the fact that the possession of personal data, especially of special categories, automatically makes her responsible for data processing. Consequently, the responsibilities of the complainant, as a separate data controller, in the complaint in question are the subject of an independent violation on its part.  B. 3.1.

In any event, the fines imposed are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Those Member States shall notify to the Commission the provisions of their laws which they adopt in accordance with this paragraph by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amending law or amendment thereof.' C. 4.1.1. In the present case, the complainant claims that, while she was absent on sick leave, she was informed that another employee of OKYPY emptied her office drawers and then placed her documents and personal items in paper boxes, without informing her first. Among other things, the original medical files of herself, her husband and her children were found in the drawers. The files in question were returned to the Archive of G.N. XXX, without any information and in the absence of the complainant. 4.1.2. The above allegations of the complainant have also been verified by a relevant letter from the OKYpY dated November 24, 2021. More specifically, the letter in question states that the Directorate of G.N. XXX, had given an order for the complainant to move and return to her duties at the Ministry of Health, after her sick leave. The complainant was aware of this particular move when she would return from her sick leave. However, another employee of OKYpY, on his own initiative, ignoring the instructions of the Directorate, vacated the complainant's office, during her absence. Therefore, there is the admission that the complainant's belongings were moved in her absence, unjustifiably and without her having previously been informed that the movement of her personal belongings will take place, during the essential time. OKYpY, in the same letter, notes that there are no written procedures in case of moving staff items, clearing office drawers and/or the electronic content on the computers handled by the staff. 4.2.1. I consider it appropriate to remind that personal medical files and, in general, health-related data, fall under the special categories of personal data that are processed, in accordance with Article 9 of the Regulation. 4.2.2. I consider the fact that OKYpY is unable to detect the absence and/or loss of medical files to be of essential importance, as at least one employee, namely the complainant, had in her possession original medical files not only of herself, but also of her husband and children . The fact that, it is known to the Directorate of the Health Care Agency that the staff of the Organization withholds medical files in violation of the Law on the Establishment of the State Health Services Organization (L. 10 73(I)/2017) and the Law on the Entitlement and Protection of Rights of the Patients Law (Law 1(I)/2005), demonstrates that it is something that happens systematically, but without substantial actions being taken to deal with the phenomenon. In addition, the internal circular dated 25 October 21 with no. lens 05.25.063 reinforces the claim of the complainant that the address of G.N. XXX was aware of the act in question, which appears to be a common practice on the part of the employees. 4.2.3. Although the Directorate of G.N. XXX issued internal circulars asking staff such as those in possession of medical files to hand them over to the Patient File Archive for safekeeping, although it did not strictly and consistently enforce this. 4.3. Even if I take into account that actions are being taken to create written procedures, in order to avoid future incidents of a similar nature, as mentioned in the letter of the OKYPY dated November 24, 2021, however I consider it necessary to take strict measures, so that the due to written procedures to be implemented by OKYpY staff. 4.4. Based on the above and taking into account the admission of the OKYPY that the staff of the Organization is not sufficiently informed and aware of matters concerning personal data, I consider that the omission of further organizational and technical measures to avoid such violations constitutes on its part OKYpY, violation of the provisions of Articles 5(1)(f), 24(1) and 32(1) of the Regulation. 4.5. Regarding the fact that the complainant had in her possession the original medical files of herself, her husband and her children in violation of the Law on the Establishment of a State Health Services Organization (Law 73(I)/2017) and the Law on the Entitlement and Protection of the Rights of Patients Law (Law 1(I)/2005), this act makes it a separate controller with all the consequent obligations under the Regulation and the said act was investigated separately. D. Conclusion - Conclusion 5.1. Bearing in mind the above and based on the powers granted to me by Articles 58 and 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and article 24(b) of Law 125(I)/2018, my conclusion is that there is a violation, part of OKYpY, Articles 5(1)(f), 24(1) and 32(1) of the Regulation, since the absence of the appropriate organizational and technical measures to avoid personal data breaches, as well as the inability to detect incidents of absence and/or loss of medical files. 5.2. Based on the provisions of Article 83 of the Regulation, insofar as they are applied in this particular case, I take into account the following aggravating (1-4) and mitigating (5-8) factors: (1) the fact that the staff of OKYpY did not is sufficiently informed about issues concerning personal data, (2) the absence of written procedures for moving objects and/or electronic personnel data and/or clearing drawers, 11 (3) the absence of a medical file management procedure, (4) the impossibility of locating absence of the medical files from the OKYpY Archive, (5) the promotion of internal circulars by the Directorate of G.N. XXX, with which he repeatedly calls on the staff to return to the Archives medical files that he may have in his possession, (6) the fact that an employee of OKYpY acted arbitrarily, despite the orders of the Directorate of the Organization, (7) the examination for taking more effective organizational and technical measures to comply with the provisions of the Regulation, and (8) cooperation with my Office. 5.3. Having taken into account and taken into account ‚Äì (a) The applicable legislative basis regarding the prescribed administrative sanctions in the provisions of Article 58(2) and Article 83 of the Regulation. (b) All the circumstances and factors that OKYpY put before me based on all existing correspondence. (c) The above mitigating and aggravating factors. I consider that, under the circumstances, the imposition of an administrative fine is not justified, since the employee in question acted arbitrarily, despite the orders of the Directorate of the Organization and at the same time measuring the responsibility of the complainant herself, who was in possession of original physical medical files. 5.4. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the above facts, the legal aspect on which this Decision is based and the analysis as explained above, exercising the powers granted to me by Article 58(2)(d) of the Regulation, I issue an Order to OKYPY such as: (a) prepare written procedures regarding the transfer of personnel and the movement of their personal belongings and if deemed necessary, update and/or strengthen the existing written procedures, and (b) take strict measures, in order to implement the written procedures , on behalf of the employees of OKYpY, within one and a half (1.5) months from the receipt of this Decision. 5.5. In the event that the above deadline has passed and OKYPY has not informed me of its compliance with the above within the set date, providing relevant evidence, I will consider whether it is appropriate for me to take further corrective measures, including the administrative sanction offine.
 
5.6. It is further provided that, in the event of future submission to my Office
complaint of a similar nature, the complaint will be examined, among others, for
potential violation of the Order, which, according to article 33(1)(b) of the Law
125(I)/2018, constitutes a criminal offence.
