the use of data management based on the employer's legitimate interests is justified.
 
Pursuant to the legal basis of legitimate interest in Article 6(1)(f)4 of the General Data Protection Regulation
therefore, personal data can be processed if the data is managed by the data controller (or
third party) is necessary to assert its legitimate interest, unless these interests

It is essential that the employer, as a data controller, has a consideration of interests when referring to this legal basis

it must be established whether personal data can be processed. If the consideration of interests

From the "principle of accountability" according to Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation

in writing

 
During the clarification of the facts, the Authority asked why statements of consent were made
on the part of employees, when the data subject's consent cannot form the legal basis for data management
nor according to the system's own data protection policy.6 The Customer replied that the cameras
prior to installation, he consulted with the employees, who agreed for the purpose of asset protection
for installation. These contributions
possible later ones are also recorded
to avoid disagreements. The customer also declared that he does not have the
in relation to the camera system with an interest assessment test.
 
Based on the above, despite the provisions of the data protection regulations, the Customer is in practice
based on the consent of those concerned, the operation of the camera surveillance system is based on its own right
instead of his interest. This is supported by the consent statements requested, as well as the interest assessment
lack of test.
 
However, based on the provisions of the previous subsection III./1./1) of the decision, a workplace cameraman
the use of a monitoring system cannot be based on the employees' consent. It's like that
systems may be operated at the workplace based on the legitimate interests of the data controller.
 
In addition, the regulations have taken verbatim quotes about the legality of the system's application

are irrelevant. These additional laws are listed under the "data management basis
legislation" in the regulation. The regulations also include Infotv.
general provisions adopted from the invalid text8 are included in the data protection register
also about the registration obligation.
 
Based on the above, it is clear from the regulations created in connection with the operation of the system that the Customer
randomly stitched together by a template used as a probably invalid

Here, the Authority states that in the data management regulations, the data controller has exactly

2. The purpose of the examined data management

 
1) Data management in the customer's answers to the Authority and in the attached documentation
aims to protect the safety of the buildings and the assets located there, and a
protection of hazardous materials and security of payment operations, as well as personal protection purposes
marked. The purpose of operating the camera system is therefore not the work of the employees
monitoring and influencing, but personal and property protection.
 
In this regard, it is important to mention that camera surveillance in the workplace is absolute
its limit is the respect for human dignity, so cameras are used by the employees and the
not to operate for the permanent observation of their activities without an express purpose
may. It is also considered illegal to use an electronic monitoring system that
whose purpose is to influence the behavior of employees at work, the employees
permanent monitoring and control with cameras. This is because it is for verification purposes
monitoring typically violates the necessity-proportionality principle, since the employer has many
there is another way to live in Mt. 11/A. with the right of inspection according to paragraph (1) of § So that's why
it is not possible to operate cameras that only show employees and their work
activity is monitored on a permanent basis. Exceptions are workplaces where a
the life and physical integrity of employees may be in direct danger, so it can be operated exceptionally
camera in, for example, an assembly hall, a smelter,
in industrial plants or other sources of danger
in facilities containing However, it should be emphasized that only in that case
operable camera in order to protect the life and physical integrity of employees, if there is danger
actually exists and is immediate, that is, the possible danger cannot be constitutional
acceptable data management purpose. However, the employer must prove all of this
in a balance of interests test.
 
In the case of monitoring for the purpose of property protection, the employer must also do so
to prove it
during the consideration of interests, that there are actually circumstances that justify it
the placement of some cameras and other means cannot ensure the goal to be achieved. Asset protection
in the case of surveillance for the purpose of monitoring, another important requirement is that the employer pay particular attention to
it must be such that the angle of view of the given camera is basically aimed at the asset to be protected,
and, as a result of the above, do not monitor the work of employees
suitable tool.
 
In addition, it is also not possible to use an electronic monitoring system in a room that
which was designated for the employees to spend their breaks between work. An exception to this
may be the case if there is some valuable asset to be protected in this room,
in connection with which some employer's interest can be justified (for example, employees
the equipment was damaged several times and the employer had to pay for the damage). In this
in this case, a camera can be placed in the room for this specific purpose, but then the
the employer - following the principle of data saving - also needs special attention
that the angle of view of the camera can only be directed at the asset to be protected.
 
2) Based on the customer's answers and the images sent by the placed cameras
it can be established that they are:

- The workshop for car assembly work in the building was stored there

cars and tools are monitored (3 cameras).

 

13



 

- Observes a warehouse and the goods, tools and parts stored there (1

piece of camera).

- He observes the waiting room and office for receiving customers, where the camera

the cash register and bank card reader terminal (1 camera) also fall into its field of vision.

- Monitors the kitchen area, directed at the dining table (1 camera).

in connection with its activities

 
According to the judgment of the Authority and according to the legal provisions referred to above, the Customer
for personal and property protection purposes indicated by the 3 cameras in the workshop
transmitted image, and the image transmitted by 1 camera monitoring the warehouse
can be answered. Work in these rooms is dangerous
(car mechanic
activity), as well as high-value assets stored there (cars, tools, etc.)
can justify its camera surveillance, in the event that the proportionality of this is determined by the Customer a
can prove it during an interest assessment.
 
The customer also has asset protection purposes in connection with the camera surveillance of the customer waiting room and cash register
marked, as well as the safekeeping of dangerous substances, business, payment, banking and securities secrets
protection as well. The reason for this is that the cash register, till, card reader, computers are stored here,
as well as the key to the storage of the external dangerous substance. Based on the Authority's position, in the customer waiting room
the angle of view of the installed camera is suitable for seeing the employees and the there
arriving customers, customers The customer is entitled to view the camera image on his employee
check through The reason for this is that not only the cash register is in the camera's field of view,
a workstation with a card reader and the key cabinet, but almost the entire room -
including the customer service desk, he observes. Constant monitoring of this last part of the room
neither the protection of assets nor the safeguarding of dangerous substances and the protection of business and payment secrets
purpose is not justified. The Authority notes that bank and securities marked by the Client are confidential
protection Customer
it cannot even arise, as it is not a credit institution
business undertaking activities.
 
Finally, in connection with the observation of the kitchen, the Customer referred to the fact that there was no work there
going on, only rest and dining activities, in addition, the company's armor cartridge is also located here.
In connection with the observation of this room, the Authority determines that the angle of view of the camera is that
it is aimed at the dining table, and the mentioned armor cartridge does not fall into it. By the camera
therefore, the transmitted image is not suitable for carrying out surveillance for the purpose of personal and property protection,
on the other hand, employees spend their breaks (meals) here. Camera angle
therefore, it is suitable for unwarranted surveillance of employees during their breaks,
on the other hand, it cannot fulfill the specified asset protection purpose, as it does not fall into that armor cartridge
into it.
 
3) Based on the above, the Authority determines that the "office-customer waiting room" of the Customer's headquarters and
The viewing angle of the camera installed in the "kitchen" premises is suitable for the employees and is unreasonable
monitoring, so it is not compatible with the original goal of personal and property protection. THE
data management via camera therefore violates Article 5 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
the principle of "boundedness to purpose" according to paragraph b).
 
In addition, since the visual text of the mentioned cameras is not aimed at the assets to be protected, but
the image it conveys includes a wider spectrum of vision, thus enabling the
complete monitoring of premises as well, according to the Authority's point of view, the principle of data saving - that
Article 5 (1) point c) of the General Data Protection Regulation - is also violated by the Respondent
data management.

In view of the above, the Authority called on the Applicant in the operative part of this decision,
that the viewing angles of the cameras installed in the "office-customer waiting room" and "kitchen" rooms of your premises
set them up so that they are not suitable for unwarranted surveillance of employees and
serve only property protection purposes.
 

3. Informing the affected parties about the investigated data management

 
1) In the case of data management related to workplace camera surveillance
essential
requirement that employees about data management are appropriate, transparent and easy
receive interpretable information. In this regard, the following must be taken into account:
 
Pursuant to Section 9 (2) of the Mt.: "On the manner, conditions and
about its expected duration, and about the circumstances supporting its necessity and proportionality a
the employee must be informed in writing in advance." Mt. 11/A. According to § (1), if a
the employer also uses a technical device to check the employees, in writing in advance
must inform them.
 
Article 13 (1)-(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation states that data management
what about
information must be made available to employees
in relation to data management.
 
In the case of data management related to camera surveillance, the General Data Protection Regulation
according to the system of requirements prescribed by
must be informed of circumstances:

- about the person operating the electronic monitoring system (legal or natural

with the exact name of the person) and contact details,

- the contact information of the data protection officer, if the data controller has appointed one

person,

- about the location of the individual cameras and the purpose they serve in relation to them
about the observed area, object, or whether you are direct with the given camera

- on the legal basis of data management,

- on the definition of the legitimate interest of the data controller,

- on the duration of storage of the recording,

- about the range of persons entitled to access the data, and whether the recordings

justify to employees why

 
Regarding the obligation to provide information, it is also necessary to point out that the employer
for each camera, you must indicate exactly what kind of camera it is
for which purpose it was placed in the given area and to which area and equipment the camera's angle of view is directed.
The employer with this
can be considered
monitoring of the given area is necessary. The practice is not acceptable when a
the employer only informs the employees in general that it is electronic
uses a monitoring system in the workplace.
 
The following are based on the documents provided and sent by the client at the request of the Authority
can be determined from the information related to the operation of the camera system.
 
The main findings of the document called "data management information for the camera surveillance system".
are as follows: The primary purpose of using the system is human life, physical integrity, personal
protection of freedom, safeguarding of dangerous substances, business, payment, banking and securities secrecy
protection and asset protection. The system is not aimed at employees
influencing his behavior.
 
A Customer has been designated as a data controller. The name and contact details of […] have been added as contact details
for indication.
 
They were also marked separately for the six cameras in total
data management purposes (which is uniformly property protection) and the monitored area. The recordings
According to the information, the storage period is uniformly three working days, which is in extremely justified cases
It can be extended up to 30 days. After the storage time, the recordings are automatically deleted

possibility, only "in case of event". The legal basis for data management is only as follows:
information that "the legality of the data management of the system does not require the observed
consent of persons".
 
Additional legislation specified by the customer in the information sheet (Act LXVI of 1995, 335/2005
(XII. 29.) Government Decree, CVIII of 2001 Act and Act C of 2003) on data management
are completely irrelevant, as they are not in relation to camera data management
contain applicable regulations. In any case, the purpose of referring to them was not achieved
to be indicated in the information sheet, so listing them is completely unnecessary.
 
The customer also forwarded to the Authority a "data management agreement" dated May 20, 2019
information" document, which, however, does not apply to the camera system, thus
the Authority does not make any further findings in this regard.
 
2) In relation to the above, it can be established that the information on data management contains errors
the legal basis of data management, as it is not clearly indicated, only the consent of the data subject
refers to the need for its acquisition. Here, for the Customer, it is the legal basis for data management
point f) of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, i.e. the legitimate interest of the data controller
should have indicated, as stated in Decision III/1. was also explained in The legitimate interest
and in the case of data management based on
results, however, according to the Customer's statement, he does not have any. In addition, the

 

16



 

information, similar to the system's data management regulations, completely irrelevant legislation
and also indicates goals (see point III./1. of the legal basis and point III./2. of the decision
in terms of goals).
 
In addition to the above, the data management information sheet does not contain information about the employees
what rights they have in connection with the electronic monitoring system and in what way
can exercise their rights, and also that in connection with the enforcement of their rights to the Authority
they can turn.
 
Article 13 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation stipulates that the data controller a
at the time of obtaining personal data, you must provide the data subject with the
all of the listed information.
 
In relation to the above, the Authority concludes that the information does not meet the general requirements
of data protection Article 13, paragraphs (1)-(2) due to the following aspects:

- the actual legal basis for data management (the legitimate interest of the data controller) has not been indicated,
- the prospectus does not include the interest assessment test,
- the information sheet refers to legislation irrelevant from the point of view of data management,
- the information also indicates purposes unrelated to data management (business, payment, banking

and protection of securities secrets),

- the information sheet does not contain information about the rights of the data subjects and the possibilities of legal enforcement

information.

 
The Customer forwarded to the Authority a photograph that appears to be pictographed
placed a warning sign at the entrance to the business premises for camera surveillance
to be called on May 8, 2021. Because additional information is provided
requirement that the employer is obliged to post a warning sign about the fact that
applies an electronic monitoring system9 in a given area, but the Customer only handles the data
It complied more than two months after it started on March 5, 2021, so it is a requirement
the requirement of adequate information was not fulfilled either.
 
Based on the above, it can thus be established that the Customer was not present at the registered office and the available one
based on information, there is currently no adequate information on camera data management a
for employees working at the site (a total of 6 people during the examined period).
 
Based on the above, the Authority determined that the Customer violated the general data protection
paragraphs (1)-(2) of Article 13 of the Decree, and therefore called for legal compliance
to prepare a data protection information sheet.
 

5. Findings related to the applied sanction.

 
The Authority has examined what type of sanction it intends to apply to the Application
due to the revealed violations and whether it is justified to impose a data protection fine against him. E
in the scope of the Authority, Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation and Infotv. 75/A. §-the
based on Infotv. § 61, paragraph (5), was considered by all the relevant parties of the case

a warning and a warning in itself is not a sufficiently proportionate and dissuasive sanction,
therefore, the imposition of the fine is justified.
 
In establishing the necessity of imposing a fine, the Authority considered the violations
aggravating and mitigating circumstances as follows:
 
Aggravating circumstances:
