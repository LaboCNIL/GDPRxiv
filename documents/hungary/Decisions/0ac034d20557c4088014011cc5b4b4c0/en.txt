According to the constant and consistent practice of the Authority, the data controller is responsible for what he has done

Based on the Applicant's request, the Authority established that in the present case, the Applicant
data management does not comply with the referenced legal provisions due to the following:

In this case, the legal basis for data management related to camera surveillance is the Respondent

As stated in the Guidelines, the legal basis for camera surveillance is mostly applicable
the legitimate interest of the data controller or a third party in accordance with Article 6 (1) point f) of the GDPR
may be the legal basis for a vital interest according to Article 6 (1) point d) of the GDPR
Nor does the guideline list it among the legal bases that realistically arise, that – taking into account (46)
also for the preamble - it cannot be used with surveillance by the camera system
for related data management. On the one hand, the Authority points out that the Respondent did not prove that
data management would not be possible on any other legal basis, or the basis for point d) listed there
Public or private interests similar to reasons have not been identified by the Respondent in the present case, and
the Authority could not establish this either.

In view of the above, the Authority concludes that the Respondent by being on the terrace
the operated camera system continuously records images and sounds for those involved
uses personal data without legal basis.

The Authority is for the part of the request relating to point d) of Article 58 (2) of the GDPR

The Authority emphasizes that there are only limited, express legal requirements for monitoring public areas

Camera surveillance can be carried out in public areas primarily on the basis of legal authorization (e.g.:

data management,

 

For data subjects in Article 13 (1) and (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
in accordance with the provisions, it is necessary to provide information about the circumstances of data management.
 
Chapter 7 of the Guidelines provides detailed information for those concerned
in connection with information. According to this, in the case of camera surveillance, the data controller
a multi-level approach should be used and to ensure transparency a
regarding video camera surveillance, the most important information on the warning sign (first
level) must be indicated, and the additional mandatory data can be provided in another way (second level).
The first-level information (warning sign) must be displayed so that the affected person is the observed one

as well as the place and method of its availability. In addition, a pictogram can also be applied to it
in order to be clearly visible to those concerned with the camera surveillance system
data management.
 
The second level of information must also be in a place easily accessible to the person concerned
to be made available, for example in a central location (at the information desk, reception or
at the checkout) in the form of a comprehensive information sheet or easily visible poster.
In accordance with the above, the first level warning sign must clearly refer to the
for second level information. In addition, in the first level of information - if available
with this the data controller - it is worth referring to the digital source of the second level of information
(e.g. QR code or website address). However, the information is not in digital form either

The Applicant has attached the photograph showing the pictogram pasted on the front door,
and the Respondent stated that in their drink labels with the same pictogram and
text also informs those concerned about the camera surveillance system, however
in addition, additional data management information can be found in Article 13 (1) and (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
in accordance with paragraph 1, the Respondent did not provide the affected parties, so the Authority
states that the Respondent has violated Article 13 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation and
(2) paragraph.
 
 
IV.4. Request to delete personal data
 
The Applicant's request for the deletion of personal data managed by the Respondent is its own

IV.5. Legal consequences
 
Pursuant to the above, the Authority is Article 58(2)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation

the provisions of the data protection decree, and pursuant to point d) of the same paragraph, the Authority
obliged the Applicant to perform its data management operations - as appropriate, in a specified manner

The Authority ex officio examined whether a data protection fine against the Application was justified

Based on the above, the Authority decided in accordance with the provisions of the statutory part.
