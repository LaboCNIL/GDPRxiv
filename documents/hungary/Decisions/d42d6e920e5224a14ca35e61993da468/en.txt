I. Procedure of the procedure
 
I.1. The History Case
 
(1) The Authority in the history investigation procedure No. NAIH-5161/2021 (hereinafter: History
Case) on the basis of a complaint by the Customer as a legal entity engaged in financial institution activities
data management, that the recorded audio of customer service calls is automatically recorded
analyzes it and whether it provides relevant information to those concerned. The Customer is the analysis
using its results, determine which dissatisfied customer needs to be called back,
in this regard, it is automatically analyzed by both the caller and the person concerned, among other things
customer service employee's emotional state and other characteristics of the conversation. The History
In this case, the complainant can find a sentence on the Customer's website referring to voice analysis
based on information, he asked questions about this, but he did not receive satisfactory information
answers, so he turned to the Authority.
 
(2) The Client received the Authority's request on July 5, 2021, number NAIH-5161-5/2021
in his reply letter filed under, he made the following substantive statements in the Background Case, which
the Authority classified the justification in the present procedure as III. in point:

(i) The audio analysis application (hereinafter: Software) was introduced by the Customer on 26.05.2017. THE
the goal of the development was to make the work of nearly 180 telephone employees more effective,
by improving the call selection procedure of the approximately 20 employees listening in on calls. THE
wiretapping takes place by means of random selection even when using the system, but
the calls are prioritized by the Software based on the characteristics established by the Software. These characteristics
they are not even known to the Customer, the software handles it privately. Call evaluation detailed
results, the evaluated aspects cannot be known.

(ii) The purpose of the Software is to make quality control more professional for the Customer's employees
individual development (professional and communication), improving the efficiency of processes and
increasing customer experience. The system does not store any unique data suitable for identification



3

or information about the customer. The data will be analyzed in aggregate. Areas of use of the program
does not include increasing sales results.

(iii) One of the main areas of use is call quality control (eavesdropping): to be evaluated
calls are screened for listeners by the analytics team. Selection criteria
also includes data from the Software (e.g.: dissatisfaction, disappointment, etc.) if necessary
these are parameters that can be changed every month, in order to be the most effective
quality assurance, i.e. they can reveal shortcomings and possible development directions.

(iv) The second main area of use is the prevention of complaints and customer migration: monthly in advance
a specific number of customers are called proactively in order to the complaint
prevent or prevent possible customer migration. Enter the system using keywords
based search conditions have been set, which will help you find it effectively
affected customers. This report can be run on a daily basis, and the interviewer randomly,
chooses freely among potential calls.

(v) The third main area of use is increasing efficiency: team leaders on a daily basis
they investigate for their team, in which calls and why it was higher than average
idle (quiet/music) ratio. In exceptional cases, this is for the individual development of employees, or
it is used to improve the efficiency of processes.

(vi) The mandatory element of the concept of personal data is missing, the data is defined as natural
its nature can be linked to a person. The Software analyzes the conversation, therefore without eavesdropping (which
and a new data management process) not a single feature of the conversation can be established.

(vii) Aggregated data on the regulated business process, conducted based on the script
they only enable conclusions to be drawn from conversations. The breaks, idle times
its length is not an indicator of individual competence, even in the case of a given clerk, but indicates
his work requires special support. For example, if it is a difficult IT system
waiting time due to access causes the longer silence.

(viii) The Software is, for example, similar to traffic counters and traffic lights
for its operation, which also determine the traffic participant (otherwise anyway
identifiable) order of natural persons crossing the intersection,
however, their operation is not considered personal data processing in practice.
 
(ix) The purpose of data management is complaints and incorrect banking transactions not objected to in the complaint
reducing the number of audit procedures, ensuring efficient and courteous customer service
by supporting its effectiveness, as detailed above. Legal basis for data management
the Client's legitimate interest detailed in the description of data management purposes is effective and legal
in the field of telephone administration. The duration of data management can be reviewed within the Software
45 days for audio recordings, statistics generated by the operation of the Software, in order
1 year for sorted call lists.
 
(x) The Software does not perform profiling related to identifiable natural persons, the calls
according to the above, it puts the calls in order and compiles call traffic summaries and statistics
broken down by complicating employees. Automated data management operation for calls
refers to, finishes with ordering. The result of the automated operation is the callback
or an increase in the chance of being included in the list by random human selection
can be minimized.
 
(xi) operation of […] voice recorder:
 
[…] records all audio by default. An automaton runs every night
on the recorder's server, which destroys calls under 5 seconds. Default

according to which all calls are deleted after 180 days, except for those with a business label

[…] has a dedicated server for voice analytics, which makes it intraday
call recordings are displayed in duplicate. An automaton plays the sounds of […] every night
removes it from the hit list. Regardless, it is still in the internal system of the Software
calls can be listened to up to 45 days after recording. There will be no calls after that
can be heard within the Software.
 
(xii) Within the Software, with the help of the voice analytics function […] ([…]) it is possible to […] and
to listen to the calls of […] - […] voice recording systems and analyze them. Furthermore
it is possible to monitor and categorize calls made and received by […] and […] differently
based on quality criteria, the results of which can be used to create customer-specific promotions and
we can provide feedback on quality customer service, collection and sales
in order to increase efficiency. The individual functional management members for their entire area,
they can receive previously unmeasured data per area ([…]), per group, per administrator
regarding quality.
 
(xiii) […], using speech signal processing based on artificial intelligence, recognizes:
• waiting / silence / talking to each other in audio files,
• recognizing and finding keywords in sound files,
• detects emotional / mood elements in audio files.
 
(xiv) The measurement of waiting / silence allows the area manager to identify the
efficiency-reducing factor and initiate an action either at the individual or area level
(e.g.: individual development, field-related training, process development, etc.).
 
(xv) Keyword recognition (based on a dictionary created by us) enables complaining customers
screening and prevention of churn (upset customer), detection of prohibited / filler words.
 
(xvi) Detecting emotional / mood elements in calls shows the true customer experience
or customer irritation.
 
(xvii) The Software stores audio materials in encrypted form on its own storage for 45 days, this
then destroys them. The previously performed sound material analyzes also after that
can be retrieved, but the call cannot be deduced from them.
 
(xvii) Automated decision-making in individual cases, including the profile linked to the person
a decision on its creation is not made during data management with the Software. Hence the GDPR.
The conditions of Article 22 (2) are not applicable.
 
(xix) The information to the stakeholders is provided by Chapter 3 of the Customer's Business Regulations and Telefonos
customer service and complaint handling is provided by means of a detailed data management information sheet, which
attached to your answer.
 
(xx) The Software has been operating without complaints since its introduction.

III. The established facts and the Authority's decision
 
III.1. Recorded conversations conducted by the Customer's telephone customer service
description of data management related to the analysis of audio recordings
 
(39) As a financial institution, the Customer operates a telephone customer service. In this context, certain
legal obligation to record the conversation with the telephone customer service
and preservation. The Authority's current procedure for further data processing on recorded audio files
focused on operations, not recording.
 
(40) The data controller conducts data processing in connection with audio analysis with the Software
in the case of both the decision-making authority and the Customer based on his own statements. The Customer alone decided
on the use of the Software and its conditions of use were recorded in internal regulations.
 
(41) In the case of all telephone customer service calls, calls of a few seconds are non-essential
the audio of the call is recorded and stored in the Customer's systems, except
 
(42) The recorded audio material contains the Customer's employee working at the Customer's telephone customer service
as affected, as well as the third party called by him or who calls the Customer's telephone customer service
the voice of the affected party, and in addition, connected to it, a unique one in all systems of a Customer
call ID, the calling/called phone number, the direction and time of the call, the name of the clerk,
organizational unit.
 
(43) Every evening, an automation runs on the Customer's audio recording server, which destroys the 5
calls in seconds. The artificial
intelligence-based speech signal processing
in addition, waiting / silence / talking to each other is automatically analyzed,
keywords according to the given list, as well as the emotional/mood state of the speaker. This
can be linked to a specific person, as it can be filtered out if the Software detects the employee's emotion
recognized and not the calling party, which is the default assignment provided by the Customer in (4) above
is supported by the statement indicated in subparagraph (xi) of paragraph. Declaration under the same subsection -

its effectiveness is highly questionable, as there was no recognizable emotion in 91.96 % of cases
in. In this regard, the Authority emphasizes that the accuracy of personal data is not
rather, an order to a specific person becomes personal data. For example, an inaccurately recorded and
the storage of non-real age stored tied to a given identifiable data subject is likewise personal data
will be treated by the data controller as if the data were accurate.
 
(44) Analysis, use and storage of the voice and emotional/mood state of the persons concerned
it is classified as sensitive data management. Although, according to the Authority's judgment, not in the specific case
special category personal according to Article 9 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
it is data, regardless of this, their management affects the private sphere of those concerned.
 
(45) The Authority to the extent that the data produced during the examined data management is general
to special category personal data according to Article 9 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation
are qualified based on all the circumstances of the present case, he established the following. The sound analysis
among the resulting data, only the emotion and psychological state is given
under certain circumstances, it may be classified as biometric data or health data. In this case, the
according to the revealed facts, data that uniquely identifies the person concerned is not created during voice analysis,
thus, this condition of biometric data is missing. There is no such condition for health data
provided that a meaningful conclusion could be drawn on the physical or mental state of health of the person concerned
to be deducted from the result of the data management that is the subject of this case. Regardless, not the employee
the conditions are not met due to the method or the quality of the data itself, so in some cases it is different
in cases under the same circumstances, similar data may qualify as special category personal data
data, if other circumstances, based on linking with additional data - which is the present
did not happen in the case - they fulfill the above conditions.
 
(46) Based on the above, the Software evaluates by analyzing waiting / silence / talking to each other
the performance of the Customer's telephone customer service employee, which is based on the manager
employees according to the Customer's statement indicated in sub-point (xiv) of paragraph (2) above
individual development, area-related training, process development can be ordered, and the Customer (4) above
according to the statement indicated in subparagraph (i) of this Customer's telephone customer service
also affects the employee's performance pay.
 
(47) The Software also displays the results of recognized keywords and emotions per call for the given call
switched on and stored, and calls can be listened to within the audio analysis software for up to 45 days,
beyond that, however, they remain in the audio recording system. In this context, paragraph (3) (iii) above
data management information with the content specified in subsection only refers back to the Business Regulations 3.1.8
point, which lists different retention periods for data management for different purposes, is not clear and
transparent to the average person concerned.
 
(48) The Software sets up a sequence of calls based on the above, which is a suggestion as to which
concerned should be called back first, which complainant is more dissatisfied. On this, the affected person is a
to describe the characteristic emotional and psychological state at the time of the call based on the analysis of the Software
destination data is also stored in the Software in connection with the call. Based on this, the Customer has a senior position
employees decide who the customer service calls back to handle dissatisfaction
for the purpose of The purpose of the Software is not to deal with individual specific complaints, but with the complaint indicated on the phone
regardless of the operation of the Software, all complaints are handled in some way
by the customer service staff. The purpose of the recall is not to address the specific complaint, but to
of the customer's remaining dissatisfaction regardless of the solution of the customer's specific complaint in principle
screening and treatment.
 
(49) In the History Case indicated by the Customer in subparagraphs (iii), (iv) and (v) of paragraph (2) above
based on his statements, the purpose of the data management is to check the quality of the calls, parameters that can be changed

on the basis of, the prevention of complaints and customer migration, and the staff handling the call
increasing its efficiency. Paragraph (3) above (iii) provided to the data subjects on the Customer's website
The data management information sheet with the content specified in subsection 11.1.1 states this in very general terms
in relation to data management, "performs profiling based on legitimate interests and makes automatic decisions
selects the calls in which a more qualified bank employee calls back
eliminates the problem or complaint that arose during the telephone conversation" does not indicate the merits of voice analysis
method and its essence, it does not articulate clearly. In the brochure, quality assurance and
complaint prevention is only listed as a goal, but the description above, which does not provide substantive information, is only that
refers to the prevention of the complaint. For this reason, with the existence of data management and its essential content
and about all its purposes, the people involved obviously cannot be aware, and on this
they do not receive information during the phone call or call back.
 
(50) The Customer based the above data management on its legitimate interests to retain its customers, and
increase the efficiency of its internal operations. Related to these interests - strongly different -
however, data management is neither in the minimum information nor during the consideration of interests
were separated, they were treated together by the Customer.
 
(51) Although it is not the subject of the present procedure, the Authority records as a fact that it is general
before the data protection regulation becomes applicable, Infotv.
Based on Section 68 (4), due to the use of new data processing technology, the investigated
registration of data management in the data protection register would not have been automatic. The Authority is the Client
upon request, the conditions and guarantees of data management are qualified individually in such cases, and the Authority
without its prior approval, the Customer could not have started the data management. Since this is the
the approval procedure was blamelessly missed by the Client, and therefore the Authority obtained it with a significant delay
information about this data management. In addition, the Customer sent to the Authority - (3) above
Article 30 of the General Data Protection Regulation indicated in paragraph (vi) –
does not mention the processing of the audio recording in its data management records related to audio recordings
related data management, only storage.
 
 
III.2. Application of the General Data Protection Regulation to data management with the Software
 
(52) Based on Article 4, point 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the quality of "personal data" can be
indirect identifiability is also sufficient.
 
(53) Article 57(1)(a) and Article 58(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
points b) and d) of paragraph 83, paragraphs (1), (2) and (5) of Article 83, as well as Infotv. Based on § 75/A a

can use the created documents and evidence in other proceedings.
 
(54) The Customer stated that it was received on July 5, 2021, filed under NAIH-5161-5/2021
in his reply letter in the History Case that, in his opinion, the Software does not store identifiers
data, and the analysis result produced by the Software is the caller and the customer service employee
about his emotional state is not personal data, because it cannot be linked to anyone, and the system is a
he compared it to the operation of traffic counters and traffic lights. This obviously
refuted by the Client in the History Case received on August 16, 2021, NAIH-5161-10/2021
information written in his reply letter filed under no
they are provided with a unique internal identification number, which is outside the Software, but on the Customer's systems
they can be connected internally with the calling party and the customer service employee, and a unique identifier for this
it is also used by the Software as a pseudonym. When applying the consequence (for example recall,
sending for training) this connection is realized. A traffic counter or traffic light

based on this, it is not possible to re-identify, for example, the fourth car that passed in front of it and the driver
to call The Software does not work on this principle at all, but its express purpose is stakeholder-specific
operation in order to take measures.
 
(55) Based on the above, both actors of the call can be clearly identified by the Customer, who
during the normal operation of the system, the Customer continuously does so in relation to them,
whose recorded calls are listened to and then called back based on this, if appropriate, or a
an employee working at the telephone customer service is evaluated based on this. If you don't do that
and the Customer, but if he had the opportunity to do so, the analysis by the Software would still be personal data
result until the relationship is irreversibly terminated
with stakeholders.
 
(56) The above interpretation is confirmed, among others, by the Court of Justice of the European Union No. C‑582/14
judgment1 in relation to dynamic IP addresses analogous to the present case, which are also personal data
in relation to all data managers who use legal means - even indirectly a
by forwarding it to authorities - they can access that information from the internet service provider,
which subscriber belonged to an IP address at a given time. In this case, the required identifier
information – connecting the pseudonym identification number with the phone number and other call data
– is available to the Customer within its own systems, so there can be no question that it is legal
tool was available for this. It is important to emphasize that it is a legal instrument designated by the court
term does not refer to the legality of data management, compliance with data protection rules,
but that the tool used is not illegal in itself (such as a black market
database is an illegal tool regardless of the data management to be implemented with it). Using an illegal device
it is not possible to carry out legal data processing in the first place, but with legal means from the other conditions – purpose,
legal basis etc. - data processing may be legal or illegal depending on In the absence of identification
based on the results of the analysis, the customer service would obviously not know who should be called back,
and the customer service employees would not be able to be controlled in the same way as the Customer
he verifies them based on his own statements.
 
(57) Although the Authority's investigation focused on the operation of the Software, such a complex data management
in this case, the nature of personal data is not determined by the fact that it can be identified within a subsystem
e is affected. It is necessary to examine all data sources legally available to the Customer
to whether the condition of direct or indirect identifiability is met. The aliasing
(use of pseudonymous identifiers) is a circumstance that increases data security, but is not affected by it
unique identification nature and the quality of personal data of third-party affected callers
regarding. The client
regarding employees of its telephone customer service a
the nature of personal data cannot be questioned, since their names are also stored in the given audio recording
linked to the result of analysis, which is linked to a specific audio recording. The third
in relation to the persons affected, Article 4, point 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation is indirect
places identifiability under the same assessment as direct identifiability, and the general
on the basis of Article 4, point 5 of the data protection decree, the pseudonymized identifier itself is also personal data
qualifies, as well as other information stored in connection with it, if the identifier is given by itself
can be linked to a natural person. And the phone call does not exist by itself, there is one behind it
natural person is found. The Customer's customer service is always at the beginning of telephone conversations
identify the data subject with whom you are speaking,
thus both the rehearsed and the potentially
playback recordings contain identification data. That it was revealed to the Customer
according to his own statement, that in some cases the recognized emotion was that of his own employee,
also proves the possibility of unique identification.

(58) Based on the above, the emotional state recognized by the Software, the length of silence and also in the Software
data linked to the used call ID and phone number are still personal data
are considered regardless of their encryption or pseudonymization, as long as they belong to certain individuals
can be connected even with the help of other data legally available to the Customer. The listening
the first audible data on the audio recording is always the identification of the speaker, thus the rehearsed
in the case of recordings, even pseudonyms do not exist at this point of data management. This is regardless of whether
whether the connection is made by the Customer in the specific case, it is sufficient if there are legal means a
available 2. Because, for example, the length of the silence is not primarily directed at the calling party, but at it
they draw conclusions about the work of a customer service representative - which or
they are correct during human control or not - even if applicable, the given employee
constitute your personal data for the duration of the data management. The fact that a piece of data is subsequently wrong or inaccurate
it turns out, it still does not cast doubt on the nature of its personal data, since any - not only real
- data linked to a specific natural person results in personal data.
 
(59) On the basis of the above, the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation as a general rule
are applicable to data management using the Software and do not apply in this case
there is an opposite circumstance.
 
 
III.3. Use of artificial intelligence in the Software
 
(60) The Customer in this procedure arrived on October 29, 2021, under the number NAIH-7350-2/2021
in his filed reply, he stated that "the Software does not use artificial intelligence
contains, does not make automated decisions, analysis results only with human input,
they can be used by interpretation."
 
(61) Information about the Software that is available through public Internet searches is the company that developed it
website, the questions asked by the Authority and the answers given to them, the Authority
established the following. There is one company involved in the development of the Software, but there are several products
a Hungarian company distributing in the country. According to the description available on the company's website: "artificial

(62) The basis of the operation of the Software is prominently displayed on the company's website in Hungarian
an application called the voice analysis platform (hereinafter: Platform), which can be found on the website
the following description was published by its developer: “The platform is a speech and data analysis-based comprehensive

there is also a statement from its developer regarding the operation of the product,

category.6
 
(64) As stated in the referenced descriptions, the Platform is also discussed
artificial intelligence, machine learning and neural networks.
 
(65) Artificial intelligence refers to the development of computers and robots in a direction that
allows them to function in ways that can mimic or exceed it
human abilities. Programs using artificial intelligence are able to analyze and
put data into context to provide information or automatically
trigger certain events without human intervention7.
 
(66) Machine learning is one possible path to artificial intelligence, actually
one of its tools. Algorithms are used in this subfield of artificial intelligence
in such a way that they learn to automatically recognize what is present in the data
patterns and connections, and then apply what they have learned to make better and better decisions
(or they make suggestions for better and better decisions).8
 
(67) Neural networks are a possible approach within the field of machine learning which
it tries to provide a solution based on a simplified scheme of human brain functioning
for tasks that ordinary algorithms cannot handle9. A neural network is simple
it consists of units - neurons - each of which, like real neurons, receives incoming signals
receives, then sums them up and gives output signals. However, the incoming signals are not the same
taken into account by each neuron to determine the output value, but –
described in statistical terms - weighted. The reason for this can be illustrated by an example
best, that if the neural network can be used to estimate (predict) real estate prices
is applied, then the Budapest location of a property is not of the same importance
is it located in the district and what is the level of comfort like whether it is the 3rd or the 4th
is it located on the first floor? It is important to note that neurons perform calculations, but
not processors after all. The main difference between the two is that while the processors
it is programmed, i.e. to be executed one after the other, it is essentially bound, so not by itself

(68) According to the descriptions referred to above, the developer himself provides the information that a
Platform as a software product, what parameters it can identify and evaluate, and how to do so
what IT methods and solutions fall within the scope of artificial intelligence
applies.
 
(69) The Software is suitable for being received and initiated by call center workers
automatically evaluates calls based on predefined rules, so for example the so-called
based on the "greeting rule" (original text: "greeting rule"), check that the employee
properly greeted the customer, or the so-called "test rule" based on which the system can
to check whether the employee tried to collect from the customer a sufficient number of questions
necessary information.11
 
(70) The system is an automatic evaluation of the performance of telephone customer service employees
is also able to measure how much time it takes to ask a question within a call
and between the substantive response and the employee's silence (the so-called "silence period"), from which it is clear
a conclusion can be drawn regarding the knowledge level and preparedness of the employee. 12
 
(71) Based on the above, it can be established that the Software uses artificial intelligence
carries out automatic processing of personal data, the result of which is, on the one hand, set up by him
list of the order of those to be recalled, on the other hand, until they are deleted - which period is in the Customer History Case
according to his statements, 45 days - the recognized emotions and voice recording characteristics assigned to each call
(e.g. length of breaks). It is not a condition for automatic data processing that the machine does the
decision, it is enough if its purpose is to produce a result that influences the decision-makers,
they are taken into account during the human decision that takes place here. This is confirmed by the Customer's History
In this case, the attachment of the reply letter received on July 5, 2021, filed under number NAIH-5161-5/2021
forming, according to the name of the file, it is a consideration of interests, it is actually a data protection impact assessment
document (identifier: "weighing of interests test voicemining.xlsx"), according to which "The data management

because the audio recordings are analyzed automatically with the help of artificial intelligence
and the findings are made automatically. The totality of the data is for both stakeholder groups

occurs in the process, the data management may have legal effects on the data subjects.".
 
(72) Due to the above, data management using the Software shall be subject to
Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation. In addition, Article 4, Point 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation
profiling also takes place, since the data generated by the system - the system is essential
due to its functionality - at the workplace of the Customer's telephone customer service employees
it is also used to monitor and evaluate its performance as specified in sub-point (i) of paragraph (4).
According to the customer statement and the online source indicated in paragraph (66). It also supports profiling

data controller responsibility is also increased.
 
 
III.4. Lack of adequate information and the right to protest
 
(73) By voice analysis and automatic analysis and evaluation of their emotions, and from this
the parties concerned did not provide any information regarding the possibility of a subsequent recall
are given verbally at the beginning of the conversation.
 
(74) The Customer does not provide any specific information referring to data management with the Software
containing information for those concerned about the "Telephone customer service and complaint handling
detailed information on data management" that says "The telephone customer service
performs profiling based on legitimate interest for quality assurance and complaint prevention purposes and
automatically selects those calls in which a bank employee is more qualified
resolves the problem or complaint that arose during the telephone conversation by calling back.". On top of that, it is
affected parties do not receive any information about the specific type of their data and what kind

3.1.8 of the Business Regulations. does not indicate it clearly and comprehensibly for an average person concerned
the duration of data management.
 
(75) The purpose indicated in the above information is quality assurance and complaint prevention. Neither is it
the prevention of customer migration, nor the increase of internal efficiency are not included
among the goals set for him.
 
(76) The Customer's statements made in sub-points (vii) and (viii) of paragraph (4) above of the justification
the above is confirmed by the fact that the Customer is aware that with the analyzed sound analysis
In connection with data management, it has not provided the appropriate transparent and
concise information, as well as the right to protest due to their particular difficulty. It is the opposite

(77) The right to protest against automated data processing based on legitimate interest is not
depends on the decision of the data controller, to ensure this, the Customer is obliged to comply with general data protection
also based on Article 21 of the Decree. Due to the complete absence of the right to protest, basically in the present case
there is certainly a violation of Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation, but on a principle level a

merging and evaluating it together, since the end result - and the right end result
the conditions to be fulfilled to achieve them - they are not necessarily the same for each goal.
 
(78) Although the Client did not indicate consent as a legal basis, it was also referred to. With this
regarding this, the Authority notes that it is only appropriate according to the general data protection regulation
it could be a contribution given with thorough knowledge, free and active action
basis of data management, which is the service
(telephone customer service) refusal as
excluded under legal consequences. The same is true for employees, as a general rule in dependent relationships
application of this legal basis is excluded, its job is to be completely free from influence
in connection with its execution is not conceivable. It is also fundamentally wrong and unacceptable
The customer's argument that so far no data subject complaints have been received with regard to the investigated data management
in connection with it, if the concerned parties could not have learned about it.
 
(79) Based on the above, it is related to the Customer's customer service voice recording analysis activity
data processing in its current form violates Article 5 (1) paragraph a) of the General Data Protection Regulation
and b), Article 12, Paragraph (1), Article 13, and Article 21, Paragraphs (1) and (2).
 
 
III.5. Qualification of the consideration of interests regarding data management with the Software
 
(80) Artificial intelligence is defined in III.3 above. operating principle as explained in point
difficult to see and follow. Among other things, it requires special attention - not only that
written down on paper, but actually implemented - the use of artificial intelligence is
during data management, if transparency and
the data controller wants to meet accountability conditions. This is beyond an average risk
in the case of data management, from the default level of expectation, and - taking into account
a risk-based approach according to Articles 24 and 25 of the General Data Protection Regulation - this a
taking into account the difficulty, the data controller must make a decision about when and for what
uses artificial intelligence and how it ensures transparency in this regard.
 
(81) The sentiment analysis and satisfaction evaluation and recording system used in the Software
effectiveness of the technical attachments submitted by the Customer in the Background Case (identifier: "voice
screens.docx.doc") is relatively low. This does not confirm that in the given form
implemented sound analysis is suitable for achieving the indicated goals, and its use is current
form, there would be an unavoidable and proportionate limitation of the rights of those concerned, even if -
unlike in the present case - the rights of the stakeholders would be properly ensured by the Customer. The client
his consideration of interests did not take this into account in any way, as of the date of the consideration of interests
or any information about its review is not confirmed by the documents provided by the Customer,
nor does it appear from the consideration of interests that any regular review is scheduled
to verify that the actual operation of the Software meets expectations and
does it adequately protect the rights of the stakeholders.
 
(82) Voice analysis activity carried out by the Customer using artificial intelligence
- with particular regard to the evaluation of the emotions of those involved - raises a data protection principle in itself
questions. In its 2012 annual report, the Authority recorded years ago that "A
it is typical of the financial sector that it is at the forefront of the application of new data management technologies. The bank
such hidden information from the analysis of the audio of conversations with customer service
can also be extracted, from which the customer's ability to pay can be inferred. THE
psycholinguistic features, as well as the use of tools for examining the emotional content of speech
however, it is not sufficient to examine the formal existence of the data subject's consent. THE
ranking technology based on speech processing means an intervention to the extent of a

27

he is unable to recognize and judge their impact on his personal rights. The Authority drew attention
to the fact that, through data mining technology, the financial institution comes into possession of data that
which the customer is not even aware of, so the application of such tools is the procedure for the affected party
it reduces it from its subject to its object.”13 This also supports the fact that artificial intelligence
in the case of application, the choice of the data management method and guarantees, rights of stakeholders
is of particular importance. Aliasing - the application of an internal audio recording identifier - usually
it is useful, but in itself, especially in the present case, it is not a sufficient guarantee.
 
(83) The European Data Protection Board and the European Data Protection Commissioner 5/2021. s. common
opinion on the harmonized rules on artificial intelligence (art
legislation on intelligence) to the European Parliament and Council decree establishing
regarding the proposal, contains the following statement: "The European Data Protection Board and the
The European Data Protection Commissioner also believes that the emotions of MI natural persons

specific use cases – namely medical or research use
(e.g. patients, in whose case it is important to recognize emotions) – except in all cases
appropriate safeguards and of course all other privacy terms and restrictions
in addition to its application, including the limitation to the purpose."14
 
(84) In addition to the above, the revealed facts and the justification to the Customer in paragraph (4) above (vii) and (viii)
based on his statements in subsections, neither the appropriate prior information nor the protest
is not guaranteed for the given data management method, so the rights of the data subjects are the responsibility of the Customer's customer service
his practice of analyzing recordings made with telephone voice recordings completely empties them.
 
(85) The consideration of interests was not done separately for each goal, but all goals were combined into one
to data management. The question of suitability and proportionality was needed to achieve the given data management goal
should be examined, instead, the Client only considers his own – perceived or real – interests
examined whether the data management is necessary and proportionate, and even this is only formal
was done according to criteria. The Customer has only established that it is his interest that he wants to achieve
data management is necessary for its validation, the individual goals were not compared with the data subject's rights

in reality, due to the structure of the system, they do not fully provide for those concerned
taking away the affected person's right to self-determination. Thus, the result of the consideration of interests is as explained above
is fundamentally wrong and misleading in terms of suitability and proportionality, and it is not
compares what should be. The fact that the Customer has fewer customer service employees

to empty your basic rights, and by the Authority and the European Data Protection Board - still appropriate
while ensuring the rights of stakeholders - data management considered undesirable and high risk
to apply form. Innovation only benefits people if it is appropriate,
efficient and coupled with strong guarantees. Instead of enhanced guarantees, the Customer has the opposite
proved during the clarification of the facts regarding the sound analysis.
 
(86) Unfounded or incorrect planning and consideration of data management does not qualify as

audio recording - in case of complaints due to legal obligation, otherwise it is the Customer's decision
based on - it is an unavoidable element of the telephone customer service, and it is a significant violation of interests if a
telephone customer service is not available to those who are connected to it - absolutely not
can also be known - does not wish to accept data management. If the Customer is the mandatorily recorded
you want to perform additional data management operations with audio recordings, you want to analyze them
automatically with new and not fully known, risky technologies, you must comply with it
also of Article 6 (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation, since it is for a purpose other than the purpose of data collection
wishes to process personal data. In such a case, the question is whether the people involved can count reasonably
to the data management and the new data management with the original purpose - in this case, the legal obligation
with the recording of conversations due to its fulfillment - the data controller is obliged to check whether it is consistent
to examine even before the start of data management, and the existence of appropriate guarantees
is constantly obliged to provide. Without the substantive knowledge and right of choice of those concerned, one
an audio recording available for a completely different reason cannot be analyzed from a data protection point of view
it is legal if the affected parties could not have learned about it, and the guaranteed rights of the affected parties
are missing, which, despite the knowledge of the Customer, was not taken into account later, even knowing this
continued data management. This proves the intentional nature of the infringement.
 
(87) Based on the Customer's decision, the voice of its employees is also analyzed and evaluated,
which, among other things, on the basis of the Customer's declaration according to subparagraph (i) of paragraph (4) above
they are also used for performance pay. In the case of employees involved, it is also questionable whether
how many actual protest opportunities they would have due to the dependency relationship. This circumstance also
was not considered by the Customer. Checking the fulfillment of the contract with regard to employees, a
quality assurance - also due to labor law rules - can be established under certain circumstances
certain legitimate interest. However, suitability and proportionality are also extremely important in this case
question, which includes the Customer's own statement according to subparagraph (xi) of paragraph (4) above
questionable, and an adequate system of guarantees is not provided in the dependency relationship
for employees who are more vulnerable than a third party. The no
emotion analysis that is demonstrably effective and deeply and severely limits the right to self-determination
in the case of employees, it cannot be substantiated in a reasonable way either. Because in the case of employees
specifically for workplace performance in accordance with Article 4, point 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation
associated profiling is also carried out, as well as a thorough analysis of the relevant rules and guarantees
necessary before data management with a new technology, which the Customer also did not do
during its consideration of interests.
 
(88) The Authority also does not share the Customer's point of view that the affected parties do not suffer any harm
suffer in connection with the data management under investigation. The general data protection regulation a
serves to protect the right to the protection of personal data, which is provided for in Article VI of the Basic Law. article (3)
paragraph and Article 8 (1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is constitutional
is considered a fundamental right. In the relevant legislation - such as general data protection
Regulation III. in chapter - defined rights of stakeholders for the protection of the fundamental right are unnecessary
restricting or making it impossible causes a significant violation of fundamental rights even without direct financial loss,
and this applies to a large number of stakeholders in this case. This is based on the Customer's statement
it means data processing related to approximately 1-1.5 million audio recordings per year.
 
(89) The Authority also assesses the applicability of Article 22 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
considered in relation to the data management that is the subject of this case, as it is also affected by the Customer
stakeholder rights to be ensured. The Customer also failed to do this when planning the data management
during. In the present case, the decision based on fully automated data management is implemented on it
with regard to data subjects who are not selected for recall by the system or not notified by the administrators

evaluation of work performance is also carried out. Nevertheless, in the present case, the Authority
established that the condition of Article 22 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation

it is not realized in the event of a negative decision that there would be a legal effect or a similar significant effect
those affected by the decision based on fully automated data management, since in their case it is not
reaction occurs. Human intervention is required for those persons to take further steps
in the case of which the Software selects for recall or labor law verification, so for these the
a significant impact is realized, but the decision is based on fully automated data management
condition is missing. For this reason, in the present case, based on all the circumstances of the case, the Authority does not
established the applicability of Article 22 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, thus
nor its violation. However, in the case of extensive automatic data management, the consideration of interests
its inadequacy is supported by the fact that the data controller does not even consider this option on its merits, as
the Customer also failed to do so in this case.
 
(90) Based on what is explained in this section, the evaluation of interests performed by the Customer does not give a real,
the result based on the analysis required by the general data protection regulation, so that
established legitimate interest does not take precedence over the rights and freedoms of the data subject
can be established during the given data management.
 
 
III.6. Lawfulness of data management with the Software
 
(91) Due to the invalidity of the consideration of interests, according to the Authority's position, the audio recordings
nor is it general in relation to the automatic analysis carried out by the Customer
legal basis according to Article 6, paragraph 1, point f) of the data protection decree, nor any other general data protection
the legal basis listed in Article 6 (1) of the Decree does not exist.
 
(92) The Customer does not make any guarantees or guarantees in relation to third-party stakeholders
has not provided the right to protest so far, so in this regard, objective factors other than emotions
(words, pauses) analysis is only possible if it is proportionate and necessary
based on consideration, it carries out this activity with the appropriate guarantees. If it is
it requires the analysis of other factors other than emotions that can be precisely indicated in the information
to be carried out by the Customer, only with guarantees in accordance with the general data protection regulation, no
you can do unlimited. One of the big challenges of artificial intelligence is to ensure transparency
question, which in this case completely failed for the concerned parties15.
 
(93) The Customer knows about its employees more easily than third parties
to base the analysis of objective factors (words, pauses) other than emotions, as it is
to check the obligations associated with holding a customer service position - the bank account
unlike driving – it is necessary under certain circumstances
it could be customer service
analysis of audio recordings. In the case of employees, information is also easier than a phone call
in the case of a third party who, as the case may be, does not yet have any legal relationship with the Customer.
However, the application of new and extremely risky technology - Hungary, among others
Also highlighted in the Artificial Intelligence Strategy16 - only very strong guarantees
and with proper planning, it can take place in a reliable and people-oriented way. Stakeholder rights
its emptying cannot be the goal and result of development. To achieve the goal, a proportionate amount and
identification of type data requires a more thorough and verifiable justification for data management
when planning. If it uses innovative and less well-known and regulated technology
a data manager, then the expectation is higher than in the case of classic technologies, so a
increased guarantees and careful planning are also needed in the area of employee control
to prevail. The current form of monitoring and profiling - especially employees

to analyze his emotions – raises a number of legal and ethical issues that have not been identified by the Client
and not processed during data management.
 
(94) On the basis of the above, the Customer with the automatic analysis of customer service voice recordings
related data management practice in its current form violates the general data protection regulation
Article 5 (1) point a) and Article 6 (1) and Article 6 (4).
 
 
III.7. Systemic violation of stakeholder rights
 
(95) Based on Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Customer is obliged to be as concise as possible
and it is understandable to provide the minimum information necessary to understand the data management
for data subjects, on the basis of which the data subjects are at least the basic nature of the data management
they are aware. The Customer does not do this either in advance or during the callbacks
and interested parties who call your customer service by phone have no idea that their voice is automated
analysis and cannot reasonably expect to be called back without being asked, among other things
because of the tone of their voice. In accordance with Article 24 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
the novel nature of data management, the analysis of emotions and other psycholinguistic analyses
on the basis of its sensitive nature and the other data management circumstances disclosed above, the Customer became obligated
data management should be designed in such a way that it maximally ensures the rights of the stakeholders and
liberties which he clearly did not take. The fact that so far there have been few complaints from stakeholders
received, it does not confirm that it did not bother those concerned, but that it reasonably did not
could have known about this, which in itself strongly questions data protection compliance.
 
(96) Based on Article 12 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Customer is obliged to facilitate
the exercise of stakeholder rights. The right to object is a fundamental guarantee, the lack of which is everything
regardless of other circumstances, it could have made the primacy of the legitimate interest unsuccessful in itself
the finding. The existence of a legitimate interest is not sufficient, it must precede it in the appropriate case
affected rights, which in this case is clearly not due to the complete lack of adequate guarantees
may exist. Given that it is within the discretion of the Customer and is obviously counterfactual
condition is the assurance of the rights of the stakeholders, this cannot be considered a careless mistake, only
it is possible to depart so far from the facts on purpose and the theory described in the discussion is practical
its implementation can only be deliberately ignored for years without a substantive review.
 
(97) Based on Article 25 (1) and (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Customer is obliged
should be assessed before starting the automatic voice analysis using artificial intelligence,
whether the data management is feasible under the current technical and social conditions
with maximum compliance with data protection rules. The Customer's consideration of the interests is the justification above
It is contrary to his statements indicated in subparagraphs (vii) and (viii) of paragraph (4), and the revealed facts are also
supports an illegal status. The Customer was aware of, or in addition to the legally expected care
you could have known before the start of data processing in which way it was possible or not
it is possible to inform the stakeholders and enforce the rights of protest and other stakeholders.
Based on the above and Articles 24 and 25 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Customer does not
could have decided to start voice analysis data management in this form.
 
(98) The Customer shall use the Software even before the general data protection regulation becomes applicable a
It was introduced in 2017. It is not clear from the text of the impact assessment and the assessment of interests that
when it was prepared by the Customer and whether it was revised at any time. General data protection
a reference to a decree does not in itself indicate the specific date of creation. The impact assessment is formal
is appropriate, however, as explained in this decision, its content does not correspond to reality, that is
the issue of emotion analysis is not settled on merit, and the Customer is responsible for these shortcomings
obviously he could have known when preparing the impact assessment, and during the operation, it is mandatory and regular

above

review – including review due to the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation –
at the time of This is supported by the Customer's statements presented in this decision.
 
(99) The system of appropriate information in the general data protection regulation serves to
the data subject can be aware of which personal data, which data controller and for which purpose,
how will you handle it. This is essential if you are in a position to affect your rights
can practice it effectively. To point f) of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
in the case of established data management, enhanced based on paragraph (47) of the General Data Protection Regulation
an information requirement applies. Accordingly, it is mentioned in Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation
in addition to special information, an additional condition is, among other things, that the reasonable expectations of the data subject must be met
extend to the given data management, you should expect it. Appropriate
in the absence of information
by definition, the data subject is not in a position to properly exercise his data subject rights,
especially if you do not have the actual opportunity to exercise the substantive right - protest. THE
information obligation a
as also explained, it is not purely administrative,
means a "de-paperization" obligation in the General Data Protection Regulation. Some document
its production in itself is not the fulfillment of the data controller's obligations, it is only the means, its recording
there must be substantive consideration and decision preparation, decision, and necessary
their review at intervals. Application of a new type and increased risk technology
in this case, there is also an increased expectation for regular and substantive review. All in the preamble
contained, and the articles of the General Data Protection Regulation require the data controller to achieve results
in determining its obligations, not just a specified minimum administration
performed by the data controller. The aim of the information is to put the person concerned in a situation where
to be in the right decision-making position regarding the exercise of the data subject's rights. THE
There is nothing meaningful about data management and audio analysis using software
information is not available to those concerned who call the Customer's customer service by phone,
or who are called or called back by the Customer's customer service.
 
(100) In connection with the legal basis of legitimate interest, it is important to emphasize that it does not serve to
that, in the absence of other options, the data controller at any time and for any reason, the other legal grounds
in the absence of its applicability, refer to Article 6 (1) point f) and treat it as personal
data. Although it seems to be the most flexible legal basis, by applying it the data controller
undertakes a significant responsibility - not only in the narrow sense of handling personal data, but that
also by assuming the fulfillment of other warranty obligations related to it. No
We are therefore talking about "paperwork" here, but a substantive task, which statement is particularly true
in the case of data management, where the data controller is in a position of trust and a significant power advantage
against victims. In the absence of adequate guarantees, it is a violation of the rights of the stakeholders
the risk is such that the result of the consideration of interests in the event of its actual performance
it can only reasonably be that the legitimate interest of the third party is overridden by the rights of the data subject.
 
(101) It is very important for data controllers to be aware that they are not the data subject and that they are not
the task and responsibility of the Authority during an official procedure, instead of the data controller, is data management
identification and justification of its purpose and legitimate interests. For what purpose and how legitimate
wishes to process personal data due to his interests, the data controller must specify, at the data and target level
broken down, to clearly justify, consider and create guarantees for this. These require guarantees,
to ensure, among other things, that the data subject is aware of the data management and that
be able to object to it even before the data processing, since after the data processing -
especially in the case of a short-term or one-time data processing - your right to object is no longer valid, thus
in fact, he is not granted this right. In the present case, based on what was explained above
it can be established that the general data protection

it cannot technically be excluded, only the solution chosen by the Customer did not make it possible
the Customer is aware according to the statements made during the procedure and presented in the justification.
 
(102) The fact that the Customer's choice is legitimate also means an injury or reduction of the rights of the stakeholders
during data processing based on interest, significantly for data processing based on the consent of the data subject
worse conditions are provided by the Customer. In case of the consent of the data subject, the consent is given by the individual
with regard to data management purposes - for example, audio recording initiated by the data subject
due to complaint handling, and the subsequent analysis of the audio recording made in this way - separate reason for rejection
you should. Because the making of a sound recording is not based on the consent of the person concerned, but largely
is based on a legal obligation, which in the first place significantly limits the freedom of the person concerned, on this
in addition, with regard to further data management, based on the Customer's unilateral decision, all those involved are
taking away his choice only worsens the already highly restrictive situation. The client
- among other things - he deliberately ignored this obvious fact on paper only
in the course of consideration, solely for its own business interest, which is contrary to the general
with the requirements imposed on the data controllers by the data protection regulation.
 
(103) The systemic violation of stakeholder rights is also supported by the fact that in the Precedents Case the
The customer could not even provide the complainant with basic information about data management in a comprehensible manner,
even if this was specifically requested by the complainant on the Customer's website
as a result of a sentence that aroused his suspicion (see subsection (3) (iii) c) above). The client
even after the fact, he could not describe clearly and concretely for the complainant, for which purposes
your data, with which legal basis and how it is handled in connection with voice analysis, are only specifics
the data management indicated general findings and references in its response
its adequacy. The Customer's defense that such a question has not arisen so far, no
relevant, on the one hand, because there is no such aspect in the general data protection regulation
in the case of data controller obligations, on the other hand, the main reason is the significant lack of information on the part of those concerned
lack of interest so far. Information pursuant to Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation
obligation is not absolute, its express purpose is the data controller – in this case the Customer –
with regards to its data management operations, its great information superiority over the data subjects
equalization. If it is a complicated and new technology data management, then on this
information supremacy is typically greater than data management that does not have such characteristics
case, so the Customer should have paid even more attention to compensate for this. This
however, despite his legal obligation, the Customer did not do so. And this supports the
that the system consciously created by the Customer usually does not meet the built-in and
default data protection principle.
 
(104) On the basis of the above, the Customer with the automatic analysis of customer service voice recordings
related data management practice in its current form violates the general data protection regulation
Paragraph (1) of Article 12, Paragraph (1) of Article 24, Paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 25.
 
 
III.8. Legal consequences
 
(105) The Authority is based on Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
may impose a data protection fine instead of or in addition to the other measures. It's not
it was doubtful that in case of violation of the general data protection regulation, the general data protection
on the basis of Article 58 (2) point d) of the Decree, it is necessary to oblige the data controller to
brings data management into line with the general data protection regulation. Due to the nature of data management
the Authority established 60 days for this instead of the usual 30-day deadline. In addition, the Authority
in accordance with the governing judicial practice, in such a case, the fine is imposed in general
of the aspects listed in Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation, taken into account in the merits
presents the reasons for the decision.



33

 
(106) Regarding the question of whether the imposition of a data protection fine is justified, the Authority
Article 83 (2) of the data protection decree and Infotv.75/A. It was considered ex officio on the basis of §
all the circumstances of the case and established that in the case of violations discovered during this procedure
conviction according to Article 58 (2) point b) of the General Data Protection Regulation is not
a proportionate and dissuasive sanction, therefore a fine must be imposed. First of all in this round
the Authority took into account that the Customer's data management practices are essentially complete
ignored the relevant legal obligations as a whole, handled personal without it
data that he has made any real effort to ensure the legality of data management
outside of formal administration. In this case, the protection of personal data - which is a
It is the responsibility of the authority – based on the totality of the fine-imposing circumstances detailed below, no
is available without imposing a data protection fine. Infotv. None of the conditions according to § 75/A are met
above, the Customer does not qualify as a small or medium-sized enterprise. The imposition of fines is both special and
it also serves general prevention, for which purpose the decision is also on the website of the Authority
will be published.
 
(107) When determining the amount of the data protection fine, the Authority took it as a mitigating circumstance
taking into account the following:
 

(i) no direct decision-making takes place with the Software, the result of artificial intelligence
are used, which are corrected by human review (Article 83 of the General Data Protection Regulation
Paragraph (2) point a)

(ii) the Authority has not yet established a data protection violation against the Customer (general
Article 83 (2) point (e) of the Data Protection Regulation.

 
(108) When determining the amount of the data protection fine, the Authority as an aggravating circumstance
took into account the following:
 

(i) The nature of the violation is particularly egregious, serious, the case is significant, the general data protection
the Customer has violated several provisions of the Decree. The largely automated data management,
the use of new technology, the social questions it raises about the challenges of the digital age,
and the inadequacy of the data controller's responses to them, the present case beyond the individual assessment
they also make it significant on a principle level. The behavior of data protection authorities in this case
may be decisive in the future with respect to the similar data management of many data controllers,
which is an inestimable number of personal data of millions of Hungarian stakeholders
may affect your treatment. (General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point a)

(ii) The longer period of the infringement, before the general data protection regulation became applicable
starting from and throughout the application of the General Data Protection Regulation
has existed continuously and is still existing. (General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2)
paragraph point a)

(iii) The scope and market position of the Customer's data management, as well as in the financial sector
on the basis of his activities, the expectation towards the Customer is higher than an average one
in the case of a data controller, the number of audio recordings affected by automated data management is 1-1.5 per year
million. (General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point a)

(iv) The data management activity was carried out using new and risky technology. The banking
sector is a particularly sensitive area, financial institutions are responsible for customers and
in general, those of a similar magnitude, but operating in a different field, are also highlighted to the stakeholders
also compared to data controllers. It is fundamentally opposed to the trust invested in the financial sector
an ill-considered use of technology that raises significant fundamental rights issues

up, and in the absence of adequate guarantees, it significantly violates the rights of the stakeholders. (general
data protection regulation Article 83 (2) points a) and d)

(v) Analysis of human emotions with artificial intelligence both by the Authority17 and
the practice and express of both the European Data Protection Board and the European Data Protection Commissioner
in his opinion, it is very risky and should be avoided as a general rule except in some areas.
When such technology is used, there are significantly stronger guarantees and a more meaningful consideration
necessary, as the Customer testified based on the revealed facts. (general data protection
Regulation Article 83 (2) points a) and d)

(vi) A consideration of interests that is contrary to the obvious facts and only "documented" is serious
trivializing and ignoring risks internal to the Customer

the above cannot be implemented. Based on his statements, the Customer could have known that because of the above
data management can be problematic, but you deliberately ignored these aspects
during his decisions regarding data management, he made them based on a fictitious situation
turning a blind eye to reality. (General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point b)

can fulfill its obligations. (General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point c)

(viii) Article 24 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the risk-based approach
prescribes to the Customer, which he did not fulfill in this case. Audio recordings are not recorded
can be avoided by those concerned, so in such a case their use for any further purpose is still
to be judged more strictly. The Customer is excluded from using the telephone customer service
is the only alternative offered by
this is also questionable for the stakeholders called by the Customer, and there is also no lack of adequate information
in a decision-making situation, the most affected, according to Article 25 of the General Data Protection Regulation
can be traced back to a systemic problem that violates the principle. Artificial intelligence is not
its application with due care is the previous one without artificial intelligence
compared to automated data management, it poses orders of magnitude more significant risks,
which can only be evaluated in the strictest way. (General Data Protection Regulation Article 83
(2) point d)

(ix) The regulation governing specific new technology is still very rudimentary, so this a
should have been taken into account as a higher risk during consideration, and the specific
in the absence of strong concrete guarantees due to the lack of regulation of the area, the Customer
would have been even stronger than usual under the General Data Protection Regulation

(xiii) The total annual net sales of the Customer in 2020 was HUF 81,002,000,000, therefore a small
a fine amounting to no punitive or preventive effect would be neither unique nor
in general terms. (General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point k)
