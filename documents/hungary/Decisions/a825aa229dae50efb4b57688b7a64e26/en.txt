are applicable.

III.2. Violation of the Applicant's stakeholder rights

According to Article 15 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data subject is entitled to personal
get access to your data.

extension.

The Respondent failed to fulfill the original request to exercise the Applicant's right of access before the expiry of one month
did not indicate the need for an extension of the deadline to the Applicant. This is the procedure
during which the Respondent also admitted.

According to the Applicant's statement, since the office and headquarters of the Applicant service provider are on 12/19/2020 and
It was closed between 01.03.2021, no administration work was carried out during this period, open for administration
standing deadline started on 04.01.2021.

The deadline set in § 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation is a calendar day and not a working day
must be calculated, as a result of which the deadline available for completing the request is December 24, 2020.

regulation does not provide for pausing or suspending the deadline.

Üttv., neither the internal rules of the Hungarian Bar Association nor the Respondent contain any reference. THE
The restrictive measures that entered into force on March 8, 2021 referred to by the applicant are also not considered
as an excuse, because exercising the rights of the data subject is not a service that requires a personal appearance.

The Respondent is also obliged to organize the work in such a way as to comply with the provisions of the GDPR
fulfill access requests properly and within the deadline.

The Respondent could have refused the access request for reasons according to Article 12 (5) of the GDPR
