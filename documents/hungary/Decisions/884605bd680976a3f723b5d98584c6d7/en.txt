According to the user manual, the cloud service is suitable for video and audio storage.
 
The Applicant also informed the Authority of the following:
 
There are two cameras located at the two corners of the building, which monitor the gate entrance, the covered car park
parking space, the green area on the plot border, your own windows, and the back plot border –
it borders an undeveloped vacant lot - observes its fence and back patio.
 
The Respondent also stated that, in default, the first camera is its own gate entrance
and the second camera is looking in the direction of his back patio, and neither are they
they do not take photos or videos, are not set to record and do not have a memory card in them,
he only uses them for remote monitoring, moreover, he made them only at the request of the Authority
recordings.
 
The Applicant also attached camera footage.
 
Based on the recordings attached by the Applicant, one of the cameras (camera no. 1) is the Applicant
observes his private area, the Applicant's gate entrance, as well as the public area beyond, the other
camera (camera no. 2) public area and private area of neighboring properties (the Applicant
the roof of his garage, an empty lot at the back, and another neighbor not involved in this case
property) is also observed.
 
According to the Respondent's answer, in the spring of 2021, they broke into the empty lot at the back
to the garage of a neighboring property (the Applicant) and the car parked in front of their house was also broken into, and
valuable tools were also taken from them. Referring to this case, the Respondent submitted that
he installed the cameras so that he could check the integrity of his property in his absence.
According to the Respondent's point of view, since he is not making a recording, it is not in anyone's personal interest
offended him. The Respondent objected that, according to the Applicant, the gate of his property,

3

 
 

observes his garage and terrace, as in the Respondent's opinion the pictures he has attached
based on this, it can be seen that the cameras cover his own gate entrance, parking space, the common property boundary,
they "see" the fence on the side of the empty lot and their own terrace.
 
The Respondent also submitted that it can be established from the images taken with the cameras,
that the cameras cannot see the Applicant's 2.5 meter high garage and corrugated iron fence
because of the Applicant's yard, only the garage and the roof of the residential building, so in his opinion
does not violate any privacy with cameras. The Respondent noted that a
you see a garage door because the Applicant illegally built the garage right there
to the gate entrance. The Respondent requested the termination of the procedure.
 
The Applicant also attached a site plan showing the location of the cameras. In this the cameras
he marked the area of the entire property as his angle of view, so it is the rotation of the cameras
can be used during operation.
 
II.3. The Applicant sent on March 4, 2022
inquired about the status of the case in his letter
regarding and submitted that the cameras are still monitoring his property and referred
to the fact that the garage was demolished recently, so the cameras are already in the inner parts of the lot
can also be seen inside. The Applicant requested the Authority to take action to dismantle the cameras.

The Authority found that, based on the available information, it is not clear that a
based on the angle of view of the cameras, which area(s) are currently suitable for observation, and
to what extent and exactly which parts of the Applicant's property are affected, thereby a
of his private sphere, if the visible area has really changed.
In order to assess this, and thus to clarify the facts, according to the Authority's point of view, it is current
recordings were needed, so he invited the Applicant to make a statement again.
 
II.4. On April 6, 2022, the Applicant informed the Authority of the following via e-Paper:
 
The Applicant sent 10 pictures showing the following:
 
Image 1: A recording downloaded from Google Earth, on which the Applicant shows the location of the cameras
presented.
 
Image 2: No. 2 snapshot of the camera's default position, according to which the camera is the Applicant
he sees his private area (terrace and yard), and also the empty lot beyond the Applicant's property, and
a lane from the neighboring property - different from the applicant's property - as the camera is high up
was installed, so you can "see" over the fence.
 
Image 3: the middle position of camera 2, which is outside the Respondent's private area, the empty area beyond
also "sees" the plot.
 
Image 4: camera 2 facing left: a common fence with a fence covered with corrugated iron and the

Picture 5: the left-most position of the 2nd camera, which is approx. 2 m high corrugated iron fence, the Applicant

he also sees part of the Applicant's property (front door and yard).
 
The Respondent added to this that this picture has changed somewhat from the one previously sent
to picture, since the building control authority was probably investigating "irregular construction" and
could order demolition, so the building used as a garage, which previously covered the
camera's angle of view, however, this disappeared with the demolition. The Respondent also submitted that a

a recording was made of the part before its entrance, because since the demolition began after working hours
and every night the Applicant stood irregularly right in front of the Respondent's gate
van, and you may need the recording later to prove this. In the picture
it can be seen that a pickup truck (the number plate cannot be read) is parked in the lot in front of the Applicant, the

The Respondent submitted that it does not infringe the Applicant's personal rights, as the recordings are only

I V Decision making
 
IV.1. The person of the data controller, personal data and data management
 

Pursuant to Article 4, point 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data controller is the natural or
legal entity […], which independently determines the purposes and means of processing personal data
together with others it defines […].

 
In the statement delivered to the Requested Authority - as the operator of the camera system -
has clearly identified itself as a data controller, and since the procedure casts doubt on this
did not arise during, and also because, according to the Respondent's statement, the camera was taken by the Respondent
equipped, therefore, as the person determining the purpose and means of data management by the Authority
considered a data controller.

 
Based on Article 4, Point 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation, it is about natural persons

taking pictures is considered personal data.

 
Based on Article 4, Point 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the image of the data subject is personal
is considered data. The identified or identifiable natural person is affected. All of these
pursuant to, if a natural person can be identified based on a recording, then it is
taking a picture is personal data, the taking of a picture is general data protection
Article 4, point 2 of the regulation is considered data management.

 

The Respondent referred to the fact that the cameras do not record, nor do the cameras take photos,
they don't take video either, they aren't set to record, and they don't have a memory card in them, just
he uses them for remote monitoring and made the recordings only at the request of the Authority. THE
Despite this declaration by the respondent, data processing is carried out in accordance with Article 4, point 2 of the GDPR
with the camera surveillance carried out by him, because the recording is not required to be stored, since a
The referred wording of GDPR is broader than the storage of the recording, given that it is

"any operation performed by automated or non-automated means" is included and the GDPR
the list referred to in point is not exhaustive. If the Applicant is only remotely
"looks" at the observed area, where the Applicant and other stakeholders may be present, it is also
means an automated operation, which is considered data processing under the scope of the GDPR.
 
IV.2. Subject of investigation

 

Based on Article 77 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, all data subjects are entitled to
to file a complaint with a supervisory authority, in Hungary the Authority, if it is concerned
in his opinion, the handling of personal data concerning him violates general data protection
decree.
 
Considering that the operation of cameras that also monitor public areas is closely related to
With data management objected to by the applicant, the Authority investigated it ex officio with these cameras
the legality of data management.
 
IV.3. Legality of camera data management
 
IV.3.1. Separation of household and non-household data management
 

The application of the camera may be suitable based on its placement and angle of view
to observe another's private area or the public area connected to another's property
make recordings that may violate the personal rights of the persons observed with the camera
rights, privacy.
 

Based on point c) of Article 2 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, they do not belong to
regulation, so the rules of the general data protection regulation do not have to be applied
for the processing of personal data, if it is exclusively personal or domestic by natural persons
carried out as part of their activities (so-called "household data management"). The personal or home
activity is provided by recital (18) of the general data protection regulation
examples, such as correspondence, address storage, personal and home activities
contact on social networks and other online activities carried out in the framework of
as well as camera surveillance in some cases. However, it is important to point out that - as soon as
it was established by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the so-called Rynes judgment2 - the private purpose
the exception rule for data management must be interpreted narrowly. Pursuant to this decision a
camera surveillance - in the part that is outside the private property of the data controller
it also covers persons staying in the area - does not fall under the said exception.

 
This practice was upheld by the European Data Protection Board for use of video devices
in its guidelines of 3/2019 on personal data management3. The guideline in addition to
states that it is generally designed for the purpose of monitoring the self-owned area
the application of a camera surveillance system can extend to the border of the area, he admits that it is exceptional
case, a situation may arise where the scope of camera surveillance cannot be narrowed down
within its own territory, since in this way it would not be sufficiently effective
protection. Adequate technical or organizational measures (for example, the purpose of the monitoring
covering an area that is not relevant from the point of view or the monitored part with IT tools
filtering) in addition to the application, the individual is entitled to extend the camera
observation of the immediate environment of the own-owned area as well.

 

At the same time, in the event that the private individual does not use the public space - or
other private areas in the camera's field of view - covering solutions, or who purposefully a
already operates a camera system monitoring a public area or other private area as a data controller
becomes, moreover, its activity is not classified as private data processing, so it must apply
all requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation for data controllers.

By applying masking, the area observed by the camera can be narrowed down to the area that
is in the possession of the data controller. However, if the angle of view of the cameras is that of the cameraman
outside the private sphere of the person performing data management with a monitoring system - for example
to public space,
area, or other third parties
owned area - it is directed, it cannot be considered that the "personal,
and home" activities. For surveillance of public areas only in a narrow circle, expressed by law
it is possible according to regulations, as this activity may offend the person observed by the camera
your privacy by processing your personal data even against your will.
 
IV.3.2. Non-household data management
 
The data controller has, among other things, an appropriate and lawful data management purpose, as well as the data management
you must indicate the legal basis supporting its legality, if the camera surveillance does not
falls under the rule of the "household data management" exception mentioned in the previous point.

In cases of personal data management, it is set out in Article 6 (1) of the GDPR
legal grounds may be applied.

In the case of camera data management, consent can only be used in exceptional cases
its procurement cannot be solved in a way that complies with the GDPR in all cases
requirements, i.e. to be voluntary, specific and adequately informed
be based on (GDPR Article 4, Clause 11), and that the controller can subsequently verify (GDPR Article 7
Article (1) that all stakeholders have given their personal consent
to manage your data. For this reason, it is basically regulated in Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR
the legal basis of legitimate interest can be invoked.
 
Although the Respondent did not specifically indicate legitimate interest as a legal basis, the relevant
based on the content of his answer to the question, the Authority examined the possibility that a
By the applicant
of operating an installed camera system, and it was completed as such
the legal basis for data management is Article 6 (1) point f) of the General Data Protection Regulation
(legitimate interest of data controller). The Requested sent to the Authority the purpose of asset protection
in his statement and referred to break-ins, but he did not support this with documents. THE
The "bad neighborly relationship" mentioned by the applicant, with non-compliance with building regulations
construction does not constitute the basis for monitoring for property protection purposes.
 
If the legal basis for data management is Article 6 (1) Paragraph f) of the General Data Protection Regulation
legitimate interest according to point, the data controller must carry out an interest assessment. In this context
among other things, it is necessary to determine the legitimate interest, the impact on the person concerned, and that
whether data processing is necessary or proportionate, as well as whether it is a legitimate interest must be considered
and whether the right of the affected person is of a higher order. In the consideration of interests, the
the duration of the retention of personal data and the justification of its length
must be proven in the interest assessment. The Respondent did not issue such a consideration of interests
At the disposal of the authority.
 
According to the Authority's point of view, the reason mentioned by the Respondent as the reason for the surveillance - and with documents
unsubstantiated – “intrusions” do not justify observing the extent of the
public area and the Applicant's private area, as currently observed by the two installed cameras.
The Authority accepted the Application under NAIH-3524-2/2022. s. in his order he specifically called out that
if you refer to GDPR Article 6 (1) point f), i.e. a legitimate interest, then you justify it
in the case of all cameras, the existence of the data controller's legitimate interest. The Authority is the Respondent
despite his express invitation, he did not send such a certificate to the Authority. By the Applicant
cameras can potentially be suitable for achieving specified asset protection goals,
however, the Applicant's surveillance of passers-by on the Applicant's property and on public land,
as well as the monitoring of persons who are staying, which is realized in this way, is permanent, for everyone
unlimited data processing cannot be proportionate.

with its provisions, therefore the Authority primarily the cameras

Therefore, considering that the Respondent did not substantiate with anything that GDPR Article 6.
on the basis of point f) of paragraph 1 of Article (1), he would have a legitimate interest in the areas outside his private territory
monitoring, and therefore the Authority - upon request and ex officio - established that on this
its data processing is without a legal basis, so it conflicts with the provisions of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR, namely
handled the personal data of the Applicant and other stakeholders without a proper legal basis
your personal data. For this reason, the Authority considers it necessary to narrow the monitored area
to the extent that it fulfills the purpose of the observation, but does not extend beyond that, i.e. at most a
extend to the fence line.
 
Pursuant to the above, the Authority is Article 58(2)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation
condemned the Applicant, as his data management activities violated the general
provision of the data protection regulation, and also based on point d) of Article 58 (2) of the GDPR
instructed him to change the angle of view of the cameras or to bring it into line by covering it up
