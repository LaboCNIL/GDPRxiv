IV.1. The Applicant's quality of data management, the types of personal data handled

(34) In his statements, the Respondent disputed that the two e-mails were personal

its data management remained within the limits of private data management, even if it was implemented

in cases in which the person who sent the e-mails acts as a private prosecutor. As a result, the
The authority considers it necessary to determine whether data processing has taken place, that is the scope of the GDPR
whether it was subject to and what data it applied to.

(35) In the e-mail dated January 9, 2021, it was stated that the Respondent is sending the letter to
so that the Applicant "cannot evade his criminal liability" and "the procedure [the
[Applicant] and other [Company]-related debtors cannot be dragged away.” Also about that
also informed the recipients that the Applicant "due to a violation of a private secret
appearing as a defendant in a criminal case at the PKKB on […] in the […] courtroom
has an obligation." The attached summons clearly states the case number
the subject of the case - the offense of violation of privacy - and the Applicant can be identified
procedural law position, according to which he is cited by the PKKB as a declarant. It was on the attached envelope
also a home address for which the summons from the PKKB was returned with an unidentifiable mark.

(36) In the text of the e-mail sent on June 11, 2021, it was stated that the Applicant did not take
through the "recent criminal court order addressed to him as a defendant, which is personal
cited with the burden of appearance", and it also contained that the Applicant was "burdened
in the case of breach of privacy". In addition, although the Respondent in his own name
attached a summons to his letter, it states the number and subject of the case, and that
the criminal case was initiated against the Applicant and his associates.

(37) Contrary to the Respondent's claim, his letters do not only contain the Applicant's name and address
included, but two additional ones relating to the Applicant that can be linked to him
also information related to pending criminal proceedings, such as
its procedural position in criminal proceedings, the nature of the crime. This data is

is considered a data controller, since he determined the method of data management - e-mail

the person who is actually in charge of data management is considered a data controller

as he decided and drove the transfer of the Applicant's criminal personal data
finally.

(38) As a result, the Requested Party is classified as a data controller, which it is not
is influenced by the fact that he is a natural person, since according to Article 4, point 7 of the GDPR
according to the definition, a data controller can be a natural or legal person. For this
in connection with this, the Authority notes that the Respondent's argument that, among other things
it is not a data controller because it does not have a data management information sheet, it is not correct, because it is
providing adequate information about data management is an obligation that is

it stems from the quality of the data controller, not the existence or lack of information
creates a person's data controller quality.

IV.2. Definition of the applicable legislation, the material scope of the GDPR

(39) After establishing that the Respondent acted as a data controller and
the subject of data processing was the Applicant's criminal personal data, it must
examine whether the GDPR, Infotv. – or the Applicant
according to him, neither - the applicable law.

(40) Article 2 of the GDPR defines the scope of the regulation, as well as Infotv. Section 2 (4)
paragraph also orders the GDPR to be applied to the data processing to which the

by definition, it does not override the provisions of Article 2 (2) of the GDPR, a
Exceptions to the scope of GDPR.

(41) In connection with the definition of the applicable law, taking into account the Infotv. Section 2 (4)
paragraph, as well as Article 2 (2) of the GDPR, it is also necessary to examine whether a
Can the data processing carried out by the respondent be considered as data processing for the purpose of law enforcement,
which he himself referred to - Infotv. does the data management fall under the scope of - and
if it is not classified as such, is it classified as private data processing which
does not fall under the scope of the GDPR.

(42) The Respondent referred to the fact that Infotv. falls under the scope of
because, based on his reports, two private criminal proceedings are also pending a

with the facts of the judgment referred to, however, the Metropolitan Court on this
its finding is also relevant in the present case.

(44) Based on the above, therefore, by the Respondent, according to his position, in his capacity as a private prosecutor
data transmission carried out cannot be included according to Article 2 (2) point d) of the GDPR
under exception rule.

(45) Subsequently, the Authority must also examine whether the Respondent is the Applicant
did you carry out the data processing objected to in the context of your personal or home activities.
Data processing carried out in the context of personal activity is to be interpreted narrowly, it is only and
it can only fall outside the scope of data protection regulations if it is exclusively for private purposes
serves. In that case, the data processing can no longer be considered for private purposes, if the purpose is
goes beyond private use, it is "directed outside the private sphere" as in
C-212/13. stated by the Court of Justice of the European Union in point 33 of the judgment. The Authority
his view is that if a private defendant in criminal proceedings as the private defendant

forwarded by a third party not involved in any role in the criminal proceedings
persons in order to achieve that the Applicant is the personal
appear at a hearing, it already extends beyond the scope of private use.

(46) According to the Authority's point of view, it could only then have been classified as the subject of the present procedure
sending two e-mails to data processing in the context of personal activity, if
the Respondent would have sent it directly to the Applicant only and exclusively.
However, considering that both e-mails, as well as the personal,
and criminal personal data to 7 people each, as well as to the Applicant's employer
he also sent it to a central [...] e-mail address, he overextended himself in the context of his personal activities
within the limits of data processing, so Article 2 (2) of the GDPR cannot be applied to its activities
exception according to paragraph c)

(47) Based on all of this, the Authority concludes that the Respondent investigated in this procedure

data processing falls under the scope of the GDPR.

IV.3. Examination of the legality of data management

IV.3.1. Purpose-bound data management

served, does not consider it acceptable. According to the Authority's position, when the letter was sent
the Respondent had no intention of filing a complaint, it cannot be read at all from the letter
who, he only referred to later in order to justify his data management
legality.

IV.3.2. Legal basis for data management

(56) The Respondent did not respond to any of the Authority's invitations regarding the legal basis
forwarded the applicant's criminal personal data to third parties.
It should be noted that Infotv. Section 5 (7) for criminal personal data a
orders the application of the rules regarding the conditions for the processing of special data,
that is, subject to Article 9 (1) of the GDPR, the processing of criminal personal data
as a rule, it is prohibited and they can only be handled if the data management has a 6.

(57) According to the Authority's point of view, in the specific case, only the legitimate interest of the Applicant, i.e
Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR is the legal basis that can be applied,
with regard to that
also that the purpose of data management is initiated by him

According to point f), the processing of personal data is legal if the data processing is carried out by the data controller

it is important that the data processing cannot refer to the legitimate interests of the data controller

(60) In addition, the data management chosen by the Respondent - in the text of e-mails and

extended beyond the necessary extent by stating that in both cases seven, his report

(62) Based on all this, the Authority came to the conclusion that the Respondent was not
did not have the legal basis for data processing according to Article 6 (1) of the GDPR, thus
investigating whether any of the circumstances under Article 9(2) of the GDPR
existed, unnecessary.

(63) Based on all of this, the Authority concludes that the Respondent is unlawful and compliant
in the absence of a legal basis, he forwarded the Applicant's criminal personal data to a third party
persons, in violation of Article 6 (1) and Article 9 (1) of the GDPR.

IV.3.3. The requirement of legal and fair data management

(64) According to the Applicant, the Respondent violated Article 5 (1) of the GDPR
the principle of legal and fair data management according to point a), since it is illegal, a legal basis
handled the Applicant's criminal personal data without In addition, it is
from the dishonoring and insulting style of e-mails sent, as well as the wide range of recipients
from the circle, it can be concluded that the Respondent's aim was no other than to

(65) The fairness of data management is a requirement that, among other things, concerns the data subject
the right to self-determination of information, and through this to the private sphere, human
means respecting his dignity: the person concerned cannot become vulnerable to it
against a data controller or other person. The data subject during the process of data management
must always remain the subject of data management, cannot become a mere object of it.

(66) According to the Authority's point of view - examination of the intention and motivations of the Respondent

(67) Taking into account the provisions of the previous paragraph, as well as the fact that the Respondent
in the absence of a legitimate purpose, the Authority handled the Applicant's personal data without a legal basis
determines that it has violated the legality according to Article 5 (1) point a) of the GDPR
and the principle of fair data management.

IV.4. Request for the imposition of a data protection fine

(68) The Authority rejects the Applicant's request to impose a data protection fine.
The reason for this is, on the one hand, that since the application of this legal consequence is the right of the Applicant
his legitimate interest is not directly affected, for him such a decision of the Authority is a right
does not create an obligation, as a result, to enforce the public interest
