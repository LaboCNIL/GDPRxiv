III.2. General findings
 
After the GDPR became applicable, the substantive provisions of several domestic laws
review and deregulation became necessary, given that direct business acquisition
its legal basis in the system of the General Data Protection Regulation - in addition to consent - is Article 6 (1)
may also form a legal basis according to paragraph f) if the appropriate conditions are met, such
and for the regulation of the conditions of data management legal relationships, the Member State legislature - a
beyond those specifically defined in the decree - he has no rights. Thus, since April 26, 2019, the
Cat. its scope no longer extends to the purpose of making contact for direct business
and for natural and legal persons requesting or processing residential address data, as well as legal entities
to organizations without personality, and the Nytv. was also omitted from its provisions
authorization for data requests for direct marketing purposes.
 
Due to the change in the regulatory environment, it is done for the purpose of direct business acquisition
data management is no longer based on legal authorization, i.e. it is the responsibility of the data controller
the choice of the appropriate legal basis regulated in paragraph 1 of Article 6. If that's what it's for
the data controller considers the legal basis according to Article 6 (1) point f) to be applicable, its legitimate interest
to support its priority, it must conduct an interest assessment.
 
According to the Authority's point of view, the first priority for civil organizations is to collect donations
data management activities carried out by contact - the existence of other legal grounds, such as
mandatory data management based on legislation, or in the absence of the data subject's consent - the data controller
may be based on your legitimate interest supported by an appropriate interest assessment test. Consequently
Nytv.19. Based on § (1) point a), they can request data under the conditions set out in Nytv.
 
The legitimate interest of civil organizations is strengthened by the fact that they are public benefit organizations
they perform activities of public interest. (Section 2.20 of the Civil Code), for which collection of donations
their social interest. At the same time, consideration of whether the applicant is based on a legitimate interest
whether your request for data is considered properly substantiated, it is carried out by the body of the register, and thereon
no guarantee can be given in advance that the registry body sees the data request as justified
legitimacy. According to the current regulations, it is therefore based on the subjective value judgment of the registry body
depends on whether Nytv. Does it fulfill the provision of data set out in point a) of paragraph (1) of § 19.
 
It is a suitable procedure that can be followed in order to ensure the legality of the additional requirements of data management
if the organization requesting the data does not require the provision of citizens' personal data a
from the personal data and address register, but from Nytv. As explained in paragraph (4) of § 18
so-called initiates a contact procedure, during which the registration body contacts the
designated circle of people, delivering the initiator's message to the recipients. The addressee,
in case of interest, he visits the initiating body himself, so it is from the NGO's side
in this case, the legal basis for data management will be the consent of the data subject.
 
 
III.3. Data management related to the Foundation's postal inquiry of prospective donors

III.3.1. Requesting data from the personal data and address register
 
According to the Foundation's statement, it is a solicitation for the purpose of fundraising

The Foundation attached it from the personal data and address register during the official procedure
a copy of the application dated November 13, 2019, submitted for the data request. The Authority
in this regard, notes that in the Foundation's most recent response letter dated July 2, 2021
according to his statement contradicting what is contained in the attached documents, the personal data

Based on the information indicated in the application, proof of the legal basis - Nytv. Section 19, paragraph (1), point a).
contrary to what was stated - it was done by attaching the founding deed of the Foundation to the BM. This

I.2.12. as detailed in point - also confirmed the above.
 
In contrast, the examined data management
period is available on the Foundation's website
as stated in the data management information sheet, "The Data Controller only collects the data of the data subjects
processed based on data provided by the data subject and based on the consent of the data subject."
 
III.2. however, as explained in point 2, civil organizations, including the Foundation, are
data management activities performed with the first contact in order to collect donations
appropriate consideration of interests
may be based on a legitimate interest which
as a result of Nytv. Based on point a) of § 19, paragraph (1), you have the opportunity to request data a
from the personal data and address register.
 
The Foundation is the attached documents (group data service dated November 13, 2019
application and the decision approving it dated November 20, 2019) on the basis of November 2019
When requesting data on the 13th, there was no interest assessment to support the existence of your legitimate interest
attached. Among the submitted annexes, only the founding deed of the Foundation was indicated, and a
the justification of the decision approving the request also referred only to the attached founding document, as
with which the Foundation conducts direct business-like activities for the purpose of recruiting supporters
proved his eligibility. Given that, since April 26, 2019, the legislator Nytv. Section 19 (1)
highlighted the goal of direct business acquisition (direct marketing) among the provisions of paragraph
the possibility of requesting data to compile a list, the Foundation accordingly
only by proof of the existence of a legitimate interest supported by an appropriate consideration of interests
could have requested personal data from the register.
 
The Foundation at the request of the Authority - as from the personal data and address register

according to the last sentence of the same point, "The Foundation therefore has a legitimate interest in the Data Subject
to manage your personal data, as it only knows children with leukemia in this way

As a result of its consideration of interests - its I.2.3. as detailed in point - the Foundation
came to the conclusion that Article 6 (1) e) of the General Data Protection Regulation
The legal basis specified in point 1 exists in relation to the data management by him, because a

As part of the performance of the Foundation's tasks and in order to fulfill its goals, it is essential
necessary, the data processing does not cause a high degree of harm to the interests of the data subject, as well as
Services provided by the Foundation and data protection and data security measures a

Based on the definition of the GDPR, the name and address of the data subject's personal data, while
any operation performed on data, such as collection, recording, storage of data,
its organization and use is considered data management.
 
Data management
must have a corresponding legal basis for data management.
 
Regarding the legal grounds, the Authority emphasizes that there is basically only one basis for data processing
may have a valid legal basis. It is not acceptable if for the same data management purpose - in this case
for data management for the purpose of recruiting supporters - it assigns different legal bases
data controller, the simultaneous application of several legal bases violates transparency and fairness

The Foundation is therefore specifically the legal basis for data management for the purpose of recruiting supporters

(47) as well, according to which the existence of the legal basis of legitimate interest must be determined by weighing the interests
prove. In this context, the data controller must examine the necessity of data management. The personal
data processing must be directly related to the goal to be achieved: the goal is precisely,
it must be examined with a complex and fact-based analysis, especially in this context whether there is less
restrictive means for the desired goal, are there other alternatives, the private sphere of those concerned

Based on. The interest must be real and current. It is a fundamental element of the consideration of interests
assessment of stakeholder interests and expectations, attention must be paid to the status of the stakeholders, legal and
their actual situation, as well as their reasonable expectations regarding data management. The
interest assessment is a detailed analysis of why the controller restricts proportionally
its legitimate interest, the rights of the data subjects, and why it follows from the revealed facts that it is in the interest of the data controller
its primacy over the rights of those concerned. In the absence of such a consideration of interests, it is subject to consideration
to the detriment of the principle of accountability - there can be no question of legal and transparent data management. The
in the balance of interests, the person of the data controller and the data controller must be clearly defined
it is his responsibility and task to accurately document and justify the above.

According to the constant and consistent practice of the Authority, the data controller is responsible for what he has done
for the legality of data management. Article 6 (1) point f) of the General Data Protection Regulation
due to the nature of the legal basis, in the case of this legal basis, the data controller must
be able to indicate the legitimate interest of the data controller in the processing of specific personal data

you must also be able to prove that the legitimate interest of the person concerned takes precedence, it is personal

The Authority points out that according to Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation,
essentially the data management objective

Based on the above, the Authority found that the Foundation violated the general
Article 5 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation and, in view of these, Article 6 (1)
because it handled personal data illegally and in a non-transparent manner without a proper legal basis.
 
 
III.3.2. Data collection from a public database
 
According to the Foundation's statement, the previous foundation management is publicly available on the Internet
from phone books

however, no information is available from the former head of the Foundation.
 
According to the Foundation's statement, the personal data from this unknown source

The Authority found that the Foundation - regardless of whether the Foundation

According to the Foundation's statement, the affected parties were informed by the Foundation by mail

In the data management information sheet available on the Foundation's website during the examined data management period
in this regard, the following information was included:

Furthermore, based on Article 7 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, to the data controller

In view of the fact that these conditions of consent are not met, the Foundation
violated Article 7 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
 
According to the Authority's point of view, the Foundation is created after donations from the concerned parties
for the purpose of seeking it, it treated those who previously paid donations to it without a valid legal basis

and legality according to Article 5 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation
principle.
 
 
III.5. Untrue information in the data management information sheet
 
The Authority established that the data management presented in the Foundation's statements
information contained in the information sheet and the information contained in the attached data management register are different
presented the data management in terms of both purposes and legal grounds, therefore no
they showed the image of a well-thought-out data management, they did not provide real information about the data management.
 
Based on the above, the Authority established that the Foundation violated the general
concise, transparent, understandable and easy according to Article 12 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation
providing information in an accessible form, clearly and comprehensibly formulated
obligation, as well as Article 5 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation
principle of transparent data management, as he provided untrue and contradictory information
to the affected parties, in such a way that the affected parties could not reasonably understand it based on this
essence of data management.
 
The Authority also found that since the Foundation is the donation of those involved
postal inquiry of the data subjects regarding data processing for the purpose of follow-up inquiries
did not provide adequate information, thereby violating the general data protection
the provisions of Article 13 of the Decree.
 
Accordingly, in the data management information published on the Foundation's website, a
it would have been necessary to present the data management in accordance with reality. Data management
its legal basis assigned to the individual data types and purposes handled in a clear and comprehensible manner
must be determined. It is exhaustively listed in Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
Each type of personal data for each purpose must be based on one of the legal bases

be, thereby helping the transparency of the data controller's data management.
 
The Authority also found that in the letters of inquiry sent by the Foundation
the information in the provided information did not correspond to reality either, as required
legal basis indicated with respect to data, i.e. "The legal basis for data management is the referenced law
provision" of I.2.6. described in point III.2. untrue based on what was explained in point
and provided contradictory information to those concerned and the source of the data
and did not provide adequate information about the purpose of data management,
thereby violating Article 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
 
 
III.6. Violation of the Data Subject's right of access
 
On November 8, 2019, the Data Subject requested information from the Foundation as part of his right of access,

 

 



26

in which, among other things, he inquired about the source of his data. The Foundation on November 12, 2019
in response, he sent a data deletion protocol to the data subject regarding the processing of his data,
that is, he did not provide information about the contents of his access request. 2019 after that.
on November 12, he repeatedly requested information from the Foundation about the source of his personal data
regarding, however, he still did not receive an answer regarding the source of his data, but the
Foundation with the questions of the Concerned [...] Kft., which also performs data protection tasks during this period
directed him to Information regarding the contact information of the indicated company
however, it was not found in the Foundation's data management information.
 
Based on Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data subject is entitled to his personal data
in connection with its management, to ask the data controller to indicate, among other things, which
personal data, for which purpose, with what legal basis and for how long it is processed, as well as the data management
from which source you obtained your personal data.
 
Based on paragraphs (3)-(4) of Article 12 of the GDPR, the data controller is obliged to respond to this request within one month
to answer meaningfully. In this, you must inform the person concerned about the measures taken and
if he does not take measures, then about the reasons for not taking measures, as well as about
must provide information that the person concerned can file a complaint with a supervisory authority, and
you can exercise your right to judicial remedy.
 
The Foundation responded to the Authority's question as to why the Data Subject did not comply
access request, submitted that the Foundation is only calling for the Authority to clarify the facts
he learned from his order that the Data Subject did not receive a response from [...] Kft. He further submitted that
by answering received e-mails and other administrative work,
furthermore
entrusted [...] Kft. with IT operation. However, since in the field of IT work
the contract concluded with the Foundation, Kft. on November 28, 2019, experienced omissions
opened it.
The personal data did not receive information from the previous management of the Foundation, so the Data Subject did not
regarding the source of your personal data.
 
The Authority emphasizes that if the data subject exercises his right of access, as a consequence
an obligation to provide information appears on the data controller – in this case the Foundation’s – page,
and the data controller is obliged to respond appropriately to the access request of the data subject. It's common
according to the data protection regulation, information about data management is a fundamental stakeholder right, which
the data controller is obliged to perform as detailed in the general data protection regulation.
 
If the data subject requests information about information that the data controller does not have,
or are no longer available, Article 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation is still required
(1) to provide transparent information to the data subject.
Article 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation stipulates that the data controller is the data subject submitted to it
is obliged to respond to the request, if it does not take measures, then it must inform it
affected, among other things, the failure to take action, in this case the access request
about its rejection and the reasons for it. The Foundation did not comply with this legal obligation
enough.
 
Based on the above, the Authority found that the Foundation violated the general
Article 12 (1) and Article 15 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation
provisions, since - despite the request being indicated twice - no
informed the Data Subject about the contents of the data subject application submitted on November 8, 2019,
instead of fulfilling his request, he misinformed the Data Subject or incorrectly
informed him.

III.7. Legality of the Foundation's handling of the Data Subject's personal data
 
According to the Data Subject's statement, at the beginning of November 2019, a direct mail inviting donations
received a marketing letter from the Foundation, despite the fact that it was previously sent to the Foundation
did not make a payment, i.e. did not donate.
 
According to its statement, the Foundation only purchased the data of 20,000 persons in its database from BM
stores, as well as the data of people who have previously donated. According to his statement,
in the examined period, their last campaign in which prospective donors were contacted by mail
út, started on October 30, 2019, after which it was only sent to those who had already donated
newsletter by mail.
 
During the official procedure, the Authority also requested information from the BM to the effect that
Regarding the data subject, what kind of data was provided from the personal data and address register.
In this regard, the BM
provided information - the data services are attached
a copy of his diary extract - that the Data Subject has had direct contact with him retroactive to October 18, 2016
did not provide data to the Foundation for the purpose of acquiring business.
 
Based on all of this, the Authority established that the source of the Data Subject's personal data is not the
The personal data and address register maintained by BM, as well as the personal data of the Data Subject
It also did not contain a database copy attached by the foundation. The reason for this may be that the Foundation,
and according to the documents attached by the Data Subject, the Data Controller is the Data Subject
deleted his personal data from his register on November 12, 2019.
 
According to the Foundation's statement, the former foundation's management shared personal data on the Internet
from publicly available phone books - presumably before the public phone book
available on DVD - the foundation also collected accurate information about this
they did not receive at the time of receipt and after. For this reason, the database containing this personal data
