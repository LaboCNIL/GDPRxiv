for carrying out activities

The Obligor's data management - i.e. contact via postal inquiry -
he indicated the voluntary consent of the parties concerned as his legal basis, since in his opinion it is
the exercise of the rights of the data subject is guaranteed and the data subjects can withdraw their consent at any time.
Those concerned can do this by indicating that they do not in a statement addressed to the BM
wish to make their data available for market and public opinion research purposes, i.e. live
the Nytv. with the right to prohibit the release of data contained in § 2.
According to the Obligor's point of view, those concerned have the opportunity to make a statement a
BM or to the Obligor that they do not wish to consent to the processing of their data.
If they do not do this, their consent will be deemed to have been given.
 
Nytv. According to the provisions of § 3, the personal data and address register is public
register, which is defined in the Official Gazette for the citizens included in the register
personal, residential address and notification address data, as well as the changes that occurred in them
contains and verifies. The task of the register is the data specified in the Nytv. and
collection and management of their changes, issuance of documents about them and defined by law
provision of data to authorized persons.
 
According to the Obligor's point of view, the persons concerned, i.e. in the personal data and address register
the consent of the citizens involved can be considered automatically given, unless a
the release of their data in the personal data and address register was prohibited.
 
Point 11 of Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation states that the data subject
the consent of the person concerned is voluntary, specific and based on adequate information and
clear statement with which the relevant statement or confirmation
by means of an unmistakably expressive act, he indicates that he gives his consent to what concerns him

although they have the right to prohibit the release of the data registered about them, this
however, its absence - i.e. the above-mentioned "silence" of the person concerned - does not mean
at the same time, that the person concerned consented to the fact that his personal data was published by Nytv. Section 19 (1)
may be issued during the performance of data provision pursuant to paragraph
can be found by mail.
 
The consent is also closely related to the appropriate prior information, i.e.
so that the data subject has adequate information about the data management conditions
in context before making a decision to grant consent, which
in this case it is also clearly missing.
 
In case of legal basis for consent according to Article 7 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
furthermore, the data controller must be able to prove that the data subject is personal
consented to the processing of his data, which is an obligation - subject to accountability
principle - it also includes that the data controller can prove that the consent
some of its conceptual elements (adequate information, voluntariness, clarity of consent)
were properly enforced during the obtaining of consent, as well as fulfilled by the decree
also the additional requirements formulated in connection with the consent. On this
conditions during data management of the Obligor, for the reasons explained above, obviously not
are enforced.
Based on all of this, the Obligor's data management in this form - i.e. postal
contact via inquiry - the general cannot have a legal basis
consent according to Article 6 (1) point a) of the Data Protection Regulation, since its
all its conceptual elements are missing.
 
Based on the above, the Obligor violated Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
paragraph, as it unlawfully based its data management on the legal basis of consent, and
did not prove the existence of a valid legal basis to the Authority.
 
According to the Authority's point of view, it is appropriate and meets the additional requirements of data management
procedure that can be followed for the sake of legality is if the organization requesting the data is not the citizens
requests the service of his personal data from the personal data and address register, but

As explained in paragraph (4), the so-called contact procedure
takes the initiative, during which the registration body searches for the indicated circle of personnel,
delivering the initiator's message to the recipients. The recipient, if interested, is you
visits the initiating body, so the data management is carried out by the initiating body
in this case, its legal basis will be the consent of the data subject.
 
III.3.3. Purpose-bound data management

The scope of the data is according to Article 5 (1) point c) of the General Data Protection Regulation
according to the principle of data saving, it must be limited to the minimum necessary for the purpose.
 
According to the Obligor's declaration, the use of the requested data (name and address data).
its purpose is to contact and maintain contact within the framework of market and public opinion research.
 
Nytv. According to § 19, paragraph (1), point c) the provision of name and address data by any
a legal entity is entitled to request, subject to proof of the purpose and legal basis of the use

According to paragraph (3) of the same section, the applicant has the activity specified therein

therefore, according to this, it continued to use it unchanged, i.e. the requested data on it
managed with the aim of contacting potential patients by mail in a personal letter and
notify them of the location of the free hearing screening service provided by the Obligor
and its date.
 
However, it can be concluded that the "market research" indicated in the information is a data management purpose
it masks the real purpose, which is also confirmed by the fact that it was submitted to the BM
specified in data request requests
subject, as a data management purpose, not specifically a
market research, but misleadingly “for the purpose of market research
contact and
contact", the purpose of which is a general concept, and data processing performed by the Obligor
taking into account the activity, the underlying goal is still the direct marketing goal.
 
The Authority attached the "Market Research Plan" attached to the Authority's invitation by the Obligee,
regarding a two-page, undated document, he found that in fact
it cannot be considered a research plan, in terms of content it is only the previously linked market research
a copy of the first two pages of the study, so that it is the Authority's research plan, and the market research
he could not evaluate it as supporting a goal.
 
In the Obligor's declarations regarding what he evaluated as market research
what kind of business or other decisions your activity has based, only for the future
formulated ideas according to the Authority's point of view. The procedure by the Obligor
market research study for the period between March 2021 and September 2021
marked as the period examined during the market research, despite this, the Authority is obliged
was unable to present the decisions and results made on the basis of the market research,
did not certify the actual professional market research to the Authority.
Also based on the Obligor's statements - "a market was conducted based on the results of the study
to develop a strategy based on analysis, to define the target audience, the target audience
personalization,
to design, new
planning, closing hearing salons, designing or downsizing additional resources" - the a
it can be concluded that the activity he evaluates as market research is marketing
an activity closely related to his activity.
 
According to the Obligor's reference, the name and address data are shared with future customers
contact was needed, which essentially meant sending an invitation
tried to reach new customers, which also confirms the marketing goal. This is supported by
the statement that it was placed on the notices until July 2021 was already referred to above
informational content did not provide any information about the Obligor's activities
would serve market research purposes.
 
In the response letter sent to the Authority on August 8, 2022, the Obligor also stated in several places
he himself called postal inquiries "direct marketing mail inquiries",
as well as the table containing the data requested from the BM in his declarations
referred to as "data managed for direct marketing purposes and stored in the DM table" (2022
points 6 and 14 of the reply letter dated August 8).
 
The Authority evaluates the above as confirming the completion of the Mandatory market research
did not provide information, the attached documents and statements were not provided by the Authority
assessed that they do not prove the existence of the market research objective.
 
Based on all this, according to the Authority's point of view, it can be established that the Obligee to BM
in its data requests from the end of February 2021 - apparent compliance with the legal requirements

for creating touchpoints, sales strategy

supreme

 

 



27

in order to comply - tried to transform its data management into market research in such a way that
continue data processing for direct marketing purposes under this name. Despite
however, the fact that the Obligee has indicated market research as the purpose of data use
until July 2021, it addressed the affected parties with the previous inquiry patterns,
therefore, the primary purpose of data management - about which, by the way, he sent to the stakeholders
the inquiry did not contain any information at all - direct business acquisition remained the same
volt.
 
Placed on the notices by the Obligee thereafter - the start of the official inspection
subsequently, as a result, the data usage has been modified - informative text
indicates market research as its purpose, taking into account, however, that the Obligor - both
statement, and according to the information available on his website - the country and the world leader
distributor of hearing aids, and the main activity of the company is medical products
retail trade, the primary purpose of data management based on the reasons presented above
it was still the previously mentioned direct business acquisition (direct marketing) and not the
Ltd. According to the definition of point 3 of § 2, the consumer habits of the person concerned
investigation (market research), i.e. as stated in the notice applied from July 2021
states in the information: "4. Purpose of data management/data use: market research. You
we are contacting you with this letter because we want to assess that Hungary
the age group of its population between …-…
to use
hearing test from our Company".
 
Based on the above, the Obligor violated Article 5 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
the principle of goal-boundness according to point b) of paragraph
 
III.3.4. The purpose must be explained in a clear, obvious, understandable language
in such a way that those concerned are aware of all the essential circumstances of data management,
with the specific goals and the range of data aligned with them, as well as their personal data
with the process of treatment. This expectation of the data controller is general
transparency and fairness according to Article 5 (1) point a) of the Data Protection Regulation
follows from the principle of data management, and can also be derived from this to enforce the rights of the data subject
conditions.
 
Compliance with the principle of purposefulness therefore consists of two main parts: firstly
it includes the choice of a clear and at the same time legal goal, on the one hand, from this
following, the processing of personal data in a way that is compatible with the purpose and goals.
The expectations arising from these are the following:
- a concretely defined goal declared before the start of data management (that is

part wishes

-

it was completely missed when contacting the affected parties by post);
legitimate purpose in accordance with the legal grounds and in connection with data management (a
Obliged to handle data related to postal inquiries on an inappropriate legal basis
founded by III.3.2. as explained in point, and data management (data use)
nor can the definition of its purpose be considered real during the examined data management period;

- understandable communication to the target group, in a non-misleading and non-misleading manner (a
adequate information in the first half of the period - especially
examined data management
on the purpose and legal basis of data management - nothing happened to the affected parties at all, a
It is mandatory to request data based on the available information
in order to fulfill your request, the previously indicated purpose of data use (direct
marketing) was changed in order to appear to comply with legal requirements
for the purpose of market research, but at the same time in actual data use activities, notification
there was no change in its sending practices, which confirms that the purpose of data management

-

has not actually changed, the market research goal has always been pushed into the background by the primary,
compared to a direct marketing goal);
additional purpose, in the case of purposes, the interpretation according to the test of compatibility, which
usually or a high degree of similarity is assumed between earlier and later goals
between (in this case, compatibility of goals did not arise, so this condition
compliance is irrelevant).

 
Based on the available information, the Authority established that the Obligee – a
III.3.3. as detailed in point - despite the change in legislation, the
data processing for the purpose of direct marketing in order to demonstrate compliance
deceptively wanted to proceed as if the purpose of the data processing was market research, i.e
as if its data management complies with the changed legal conditions. It's free
ensuring the opportunity to participate in a hearing screening, and sending those concerned about it by post
however, sending invitations on the road was still primarily for sales purposes, the Authority
according to his point of view, it cannot be considered market research, or not primarily market research
the research of consumer habits from the point of view of who buys the hearing screening
part and who subsequently buys a product. If this is solely for the purpose of market research
would be, then for market research it would be sufficient, following the principle of data saving
participation intention research.
 
According to the Authority's findings, data management is still subject to sales, direct
it took place for marketing purposes, which is what the information should have covered. With this
against the Obligee, the purpose of data management is market research
marked it. By doing so
there was a clear lack of accurate and factual information, which is essential a
for proper information.
 
Based on the above, the Authority determines that the Obligor by the data management
real purpose
with respect to those concerned, as well as the Ministry of the Interior
deceived him, also concealed the real purpose of the data management, violated the general
the principle of fair procedure according to Article 5 (1) point a) of the Data Protection Regulation.
 
III.3.5. Information provided during the postal inquiry
 
III.3.5.1. According to Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Obligor, as
the obligation of an independent data controller to take appropriate measures to ensure that
concerning the processing of personal data for those concerned, referred to in Articles 13 and 14
all information and 15-22. and each information according to Article 34 is concise,
transparent, understandable and easily accessible
form, clearly and comprehensibly
provide it formulated.
 
The system of appropriate information in the general data protection regulation serves to
the data subject can be aware of which personal data, which data controller and which
for the purpose of how you will handle it. This is essential to be in a position to
can meaningfully exercise its stakeholder rights.
 
Data management based on point a) of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
based on Article 4, point 11 of the General Data Protection Regulation, not only the data management
beginning, but before obtaining consent, the data controller is obliged to
to provide information on the basis of which informed consent can be given.
 
The data subject's consent to data processing can only be valid if it is specific

 

 



29

inform the data subject of all data management

for purpose(s) - which can be specified separately for each purpose - and appropriate information is provided beforehand,
which puts the person concerned in such a position that he can make an appropriate decision to consent
and complies with all other provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation
validity requirement. All in the preamble
booked, all the general ones
Article 12 (1) of the data protection decree requires the data manager to achieve results
when determining his obligations, i.e. the person concerned needs such help
provide, so that all stakeholders can exercise their rights in an informed manner.
 
III.3.5.2. During the examined data management, the Obligee searches for potential patients by mail
up by sending a notification of its free hearing screening service
location and time.
 
Fair and
the principle of transparent data management requires that the data subject receives information about the data management
its fact and purpose. Therefore, one of the essential conditions for the legality of data management is that
data controller accordingly
important
about his circumstances.
 
13-14 of the General Data Protection Regulation. its articles determine that in terms of its content
what information must be provided during the processing of personal data. There are different rules for this
(content and deadline) apply depending on whether the data is from the data subject
or it was not obtained from the data subject, while it is with regard to the formal requirements of the information
Article 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation provides guidance.
 
Since the Obligor uses the data provided by BM - i.e. the personal data
after collecting data not from the data subject, but from another source - by post
searches for possible patients by means of inquiries, the Obligor has the general
taking into account the provisions of Article 14 of the Data Protection Regulation, for those concerned a
related to the management of their personal data
information within a reasonable period of time
must make available.

Both notification samples contain information related to data management, and
notification samples are actually distinguished by the content of the informational text placed on them
yes.

In connection with the examined data management, the Authority established that the Obligee has a
information placed on a newsletter sent to potential patients by July 2021
it did not include the most important one contained in Article 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation
information:

i) The prospectus did not specifically name who can be considered a data controller. THE
information did mention the name and contact information of the Obligor, but only from that
at most, a conclusion can be drawn that in connection with the examined data management
the Obligor is the data controller [GDPR Article 14 (1) a)].

ii) Information about the (real) purpose of personal data management and data management

did not inform the data subjects of its legal basis [GDPR Article 14 (1) c)].
However, the prospectus also contains two legal references, which is misleading
makes it appear as if the recipient of the notification is a data subject
treatment of
legal obligation
would be necessary for its fulfillment, i.e. its legal basis is GDPR Article 6 (1) c)
would be the fulfillment of a legal obligation according to point

referred to in the information sheet

in legislation

is occupied

iii) In his response to the Authority, the Obligor provided information on the information he used
however, there is no information on data processors on the information provided on the notice
it was not mentioned in relation to which data processors during the data management
uses and what kind of data management activities they carry out [GDPR Article 14 (1)
e)].

 
In addition to the above, the information is necessary to ensure fair and transparent data management
it also did not contain important additional information:

iv) The information tangentially mentioned your personal data and address in the address register
data blocking
option, if the person concerned does not want the same
to receive inquiries and subsequently informed that the Obligor
your data will be automatically deleted from your database. However, he did not give an explanation
information on what the automatic deletion takes place in relation to
automatically. THE
BM contradicts this sentence of the information sheet
with the provisions of its decision authorizing data provision, according to which "the personal data and
from the residential address register, the requested data is only from the application, or the most recent one
they can be used within six months from the date of consultation." [GDPR Article 14 (2) a)].

v) Regarding the source of the data, the information with the Obligor's declaration and the attached
contrary to the documents, that information until July 2021
gave the data subjects that the data is from the Obligor to the Public Administration and Electronic
He bought it from the Central Office of Public Services, which is the office's activity
however, on December 31, 2016, i.e. almost a year and a half ago, the general data protection
terminated before the regulation became applicable. All this for those involved
it could also be interpreted as such - assuming that the information contained in the information sheet is true
comply - that their personal data will be processed by the Obligor from this date at the latest
[GDPR Article 14 (2) f)].
This, in relation to the previous point (iv), is also questioned by the information on it
the truth of the sentence that the data of the person concerned is from the Obligor's database
are automatically deleted.

vi) The prospectus did not provide complete information regarding the rights of the stakeholders, only
that
included that the person concerned sent the inquiries to the Obligor which
you can cancel at your contact details, which can be interpreted as information about the right to deletion
[GDPR Article 14 (2) c)].

vii) In the declaration given by the Obligor during the procedure, the legal basis for data processing is
indicated the consent of those concerned. In addition to the information regarding this

 

 



31

did not contain any information at all, in this case the information is additional
should have provided information to the data subjects to withdraw their consent
about their right [GDPR Article 14 (2) d)].

viii) Furthermore, the prospectus does not provide information to those concerned about the supervisory

on the right to submit a complaint to an authority [GDPR Article 14 (2) e)].

 
The Authority established that, based on the details detailed above, the Obligor a
placed on a notice mailed to potential patients by July 2021
no information was provided to the data subjects by all of the data management
about its essential circumstances, thereby violating the provisions of Article 14 of the GDPR.
 
III.3.5.4. According to the Obligor's statement, to be sent to those concerned from July 2021
updated the information on data management placed on the circular notice (hereinafter: current
information sheet). After that date, it was mailed to potential patients

contained information.
 
In relation to the current information, the Authority established that it deals with data management
its legal basis has not been indicated, only those concerned are informed of what it is
purpose of data management [GDPR Article 14 (1) c)]. Furthermore, the Authority with the indicated purpose of data management
in connection with this decision III.3.3. as explained and established in point
concerned, it did not indicate the real and actual purpose of the data management.
According to point 1 of the information sheet, "We inform you that the management of your personal data and
about your rights in connection with the GDPR, Infotv. and the LLC. provides information", which
taking into account that the information sheet does not provide information on the legal basis of data management,
it deceives those concerned, because it creates the appearance that it is legal for data management
would take place in the framework of fulfilling an obligation.
 
In relation to the information placed on the notice, the Authority also established that
it is not suitable due to its small font size. Data management transparency in the text
it must also be ensured by using an appropriate font size that promotes readability.
 
During the examined period, the Obligor therefore did not provide the stakeholders with clear,
providing appropriate and real information in connection with postal inquiries
about all the essential circumstances of data management, thereby violating Article 14 (1) of the GDPR-
(2) paragraphs.

the provisions of Article 12 (1) of the GDPR.
