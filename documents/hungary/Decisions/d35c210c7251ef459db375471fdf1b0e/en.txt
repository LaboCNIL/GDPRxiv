IV.3. Handling the access request

The Applicant requested access to the data recorded in the electronic log
Before the applicant.

The Applicant submitted his application, which is considered an access request, on June 24, 2021
before, for which the data manager is required by Article 12 (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation
on the basis of which a one-month response deadline was open, as well as the fulfillment of the request
he had to provide information about the reason for his absence according to paragraph (4).

The Respondent responded to the request on that day, June 24, 2021, which contained the
a copy of the data that the Respondent had at the given time, so that
the date on which a given grade was recorded or on which day it was recorded. Not given
information about who changed the grade and at what time, because
according to his statement, he did not have this information at the time of completing the request.

Attached to the application and obtained in the evidentiary procedure, originating from a different source
all documents unanimously certify that requested by the Applicant
additional information - who modified the disputed ticket and on what date - the Applicant a
at the time of submitting an access request to it, it did not manage it
did not have access, so the access request for this data is his own
he could not fulfill within his competence.

The Requested asks the customer service of the data processor eKRÉTA Informatikai Zrt
instituted in order to provide the requested information and fulfill the access request -
"is it possible to see somewhere how many times a ticket is overwritten by the teacher. At the moment we only see (about this
we know), when was the last time you entered it", and then from the data processor on June 29, 2021 that
received the answer that this data cannot be extracted from the system - "The marks
no information about its modification or its date can be obtained from the system."
 
Based on all this, it was established that the submission of the access request
on June 24, 2021, the Respondent did not manage information regarding
to which the access request was directed.
 
According to Article 15 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data controller shall
you must provide access to data that is under your control at the time of the request,
which data processing is "in progress".
 
The requested data, the information regarding the overwriting or cancellation of the ticket, is provided by the system operator
According to the information of the customer service of eKRÉTA Informatikai Zrt. on June 29, 2021, the
nor was it in the management of the data processor.
 
The applicant's maintainer and eKRÉTA Informatikai Zrt. October 6, 2021 and October 2021
It is clear from the correspondence between 19 October 2021 that the data processor provided the requested information
provided on the 19th, so it was established that the data processor on June 29, 2021, the
The information given to the respondent did not correspond to reality. In the same way, he did not meet the
given to eKRÉTA Informatikai Zrt for the Representative on July 1, 2021 as a reality
nor information according to which the requested diary data is handled by the public education institution
can make it available to them, since the document sent to the maintainer on October 19, 2021
according to the letter, only the data processor could provide these data.
 
Since the Requested Data Controller has access to the data affected by the access request
it was not handled at the time of submission of the request, in order to fulfill it, the data processor
took measures within the set deadline, and then the information received
based on which he was aware that it was not possible to provide the requested data, thereby a

The Requested person submits the access request with regard to the data available to him
within the deadline set in the general data protection regulation - in fact, the request
on the day of submission - fulfilled. With regard to additional data, the data processor
asked for his cooperation, and due to his negative answer, the request was not further fulfilled

according to the Applicant is not charged with negligence either - as long as he is aware of it and received it
according to information requested information cannot be extracted from the system, additional
no action was justified.
 
During the subsequent procedure, the maintainer received the requested data after being the first

in terms of information, the maintenance and data processing procedures were not mature either
can be said to be practice, which also reduces the responsibility of the Respondent.
 
IV.4. Cooperation of the data processor
 
According to the revealed facts and the testimony of the attached documents, the operator of the system
the information provided by the company and the public administrative body providing supervision was also not the same

According to EMMI's information dated August 10, 2021, KRÉTA is the operator of the system
eKRÉTA Informatikai Zrt. provides information on the requested data at the request of the maintainer, while

In the case of using a data processor, according to Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation
in accordance with the terms of the agreement, on the way to ensure the exercise of the rights of the affected parties
must also be addressed.
 
According to the facts revealed in this case, due to the form of training provided by him, the Respondent

was obliged, because the Zrt had a public procurement contract with the NSZFHI for the use of the system
he was entitled as part of his contract concluded through - nor with a data processing contract.
 
It is clear from the application and the correspondence establishing it that the Applicant
he primarily criticized the Respondent's procedure, according to the Respondent's assumption
"manipulated" the grade data in the KÉRTA system and its procedure
was aimed at revealing and verifying before the Respondent.
 
This suggestion was not substantiated, the Authority found that the Applicant is the applicant

he could not provide information and the measures that can be expected to fulfill the request

he wanted any "manipulation" or potentially controversial action he had taken
to cover it up, but because the requested data was not actually in its management, and it is
