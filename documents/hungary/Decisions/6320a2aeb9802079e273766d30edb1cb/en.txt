operating a camera system already becomes a data controller, and its activity is not classified

At the same time, in the event that the private individual does not use public space, or otherwise
solutions that cover private or jointly owned areas, or who purposefully do so
operates a camera system monitoring areas, must apply the general data protection
regulation for data controllers.
 
The use of cameras facing the street front – based on their location and angle of view setting –
it may be suitable for observing the public area as well, which may violate what is observed with the camera
the personal rights and privacy of persons.
 
Accordingly, the general data protection regulation applies to street-facing cameras
corresponding provisions of
 
Along the lines of the above analogy, the Authority determines that the one operated by the Applicant 2 is its own
cameras aimed at his field - in the absence of recording of public land and other private land -
it is considered household data management, so it is general in relation to these camera recordings
the provisions of the data protection decree are not applicable.
 
For the legality of data management - Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
based on - the appropriate legal basis is required, which the Data Controllers must be able to prove. The
data management must be based on a legal basis according to Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
to have, which in this case may be a legitimate interest according to f) point 3. To apply this
however, the data controller must examine the circumstances of the data management, the necessity and
also proportionality, and must consider the existence of a legitimate interest in the context of an interest assessment test.
 
According to the information provided by the Notary, the recordings are made in the area of the Real Estate
it is justified by identified "motorcycles" and thefts, and among the legal grounds, the Applicant 2 a
To the notary, the data subject's consent according to Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
marked with regard to the neighbors that there is only verbal consent
at your disposal, which, if necessary, is also confirmed in writing by the neighbors.
 
According to the Authority's findings, the legal basis indicated by Applicant 2 cannot be considered
legal and appropriate, since, on the one hand, Article 7 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
according to paragraph 2, Applicant 2 must be able to prove compliance, and a
Respondent 2 could not prove the granting of consent, and on the other hand, according to his claim,
he only obtained the verbal consent of the neighbors, the people crossing the street - including the
Applicant - however, there may be other persons, but the Applicant 2 consents from them
not earned.
 
The position of the Authority
some procedure
to initiate or file a report, you need a photo to prove your claims
making video recordings of the state or behavior considered illegal, but such recordings
in many cases, its preparation can be suitable for either others or the person who is performing the act
also violate your private sphere, so you have to carefully consider the conflicting interests
considering how long data processing is legal.
 
Given that the referenced legislation - primarily general data protection
decree - they do not allow a private individual by himself or with the assistance of others
systematically,
using an imaging device over several months observe a
public space, the private individuals staying and working there, that is why the surveillance is above
because of the above, it is contrary to the principle of legal data management. Thus, the General Data Protection Authority
does not consider the legal basis according to Article 6 (1) point f) of the Decree to be a legitimate legal basis either.

3 Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation (1) The processing of personal data is only lawful if and to the extent that
if at least one of the following is met: f) data processing is authorized by the data controller or a third party
it is necessary to assert its interests, unless the interests of the person concerned take precedence over these interests
interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require the protection of personal data, especially if
the child concerned.

Given that neither in advance nor during the procedure was a suitable legal basis provided
for verification, and due to the scope of the monitoring, according to the Authority's point of view, the data management
exceeded the necessary and proportionate measure, as the Applicant2 did not prove a reason
which would have authorized him as a private person to monitor the public area, therefore the Authority
established that the Data Controllers violated Article 6 (1) of the GDPR and Article 5 of the GDPR.
the principle of accountability contained in paragraph (2) of Article 2, because the Respondent2 is appropriate
handled the personal data of those concerned, including the Applicant, without legal basis.

 

III.3. Informing those concerned about camera surveillance

 

For data subjects in Article 13 (1) and (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
information about the circumstances of data management must be provided in the contents. He has a camera
in the case of surveillance, prior information is the first step when entering the monitored area
it is already necessary to ensure it - due to the nature of the matter - then still in the observed area
short information provided by means of a pictogram placed outside (at the entrance door, gate) is required and
it is sufficient at the same time, which, at the same time, is necessarily necessary as a second step
should be supplemented by at least a complete (longer and detailed) information sheet available on site. This
information on the availability of the latter information must be provided on the posted "pictogram" (one of
its function is actually just this: when entering the area, it warns of unavoidable data processing
and refers to the possibility and accessibility of the necessary comprehensive information), and this a
information must be made available at the request of the data subject.
 
The Clerk has attached the picture showing the pictogram stuck on the entrance door,
however, additional data management information is provided in Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation
In accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2), the Applicant2 did not provide, so the Authority determines,
that the Respondent2 violated Article 13 (1) and (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
paragraph.
 
III.4. Unlawful transfer of data
 
The Authority also rejects the Applicant's request for illegal data transmission,
bearing in mind that, on the one hand, neither the Applicant
knew by statement or otherwise
to prove its fact with a document, and not based on the information revealed by the Notary
data transfer to third parties.
 
III.5. Restriction of data processing, prohibition of illegal processing of personal data
 
The Authority restricts the Applicant's data processing, and the personal data is illegal
rejects your request to prohibit its processing, as the Authority previously handled it
ordered the deletion of personal data and obliged the Applicant 2 not to in the future
observe public land or other private land, so in case of fulfillment of these obligations
there are no managed data in respect of which restriction or prohibition can be implemented
It could be.
 
III.6. Legal consequences

 

 
Pursuant to the above, the Authority is Article 58(2)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation
convicted the Applicant 2 based on the fact that his data management activities violated the
the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, and pursuant to point d) of the same paragraph a
The Authority obliged Applicant 2 to perform its data management operations - as specified
manner and within a specified period of time - harmonized by the General Data Protection Regulation
with its provisions as indicated in the relevant section. In addition, the Authority ordered the legal basis
the deletion of recordings - including those of the Applicant - handled without the general data protection
on the basis of Article 58 (2) point g) of the Decree.

even after the imposition of his procedural fine, so the Applicant 2 did not comply with the Authority
existing obligation to cooperate [Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
paragraph point f)], therefore the Authority established that the violation discovered during this procedure
in the case of the warning is neither a proportionate nor a deterrent sanction, therefore a fine
imposition is required. In addition, it is necessary to impose a fine because it is installed on the fence
cameras were aimed at public areas, the personal data of many stakeholders was illegally handled by the
Respondent2 [Article 83 (2) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation]. The Authority is aggravating
classified as a circumstance the fact that, based on the Applicant's statement, he used to live with his child
to pass under the view of the cameras, and also in the footage attached by the Szeged Police Department
minors are visible, so the illegal data of minors has also been processed
[Article 83 (2) point (g) of the General Data Protection Regulation].
 
The Authority assessed as a mitigating circumstance the fact that against the Applicant2, the Authority
did not previously establish a violation of the general data protection regulation [general
