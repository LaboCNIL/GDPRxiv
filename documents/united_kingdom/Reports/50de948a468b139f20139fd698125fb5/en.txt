Humberside Police     Data protection audit report  May 2022    Humberside Police – ICO Data Protection Audit Executive Summary – May 2022  Page 2 of 9  Executive summary  Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA18) and other data protection legislation. Section 146 of the DPA18 provides the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with the power to conduct compulsory audits through the issue of assessment notices. Section 129 of the DPA18 allows the ICO to carry out consensual audits.   The ICO is an independent, proportionate regulator and sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach. High standards of personal data protection compliance help organisations innovate and deliver great services by building trust with the public. The ICO’s expertise and consistent approach to regulation provides certainty enabling organisations to feel confident to use personal data responsibly, innovate and support economic growth.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and Humberside Police (HP) with an independent assurance of the extent to which Humberside Police, within the scope of this agreed audit, is complying with data protection legislation.  The scope areas covered by this audit are determined following a risk based analysis of HP processing of personal data.  The scope may take into account any data protection issues or risks which are specific to HP, identified from ICO intelligence or HP own concerns, and/or any data protection issues or risks which affect their specific sector or organisations more widely. The ICO has further tailored the controls covered in each scope area to take into Humberside Police – ICO Data Protection Audit Executive Summary – May 2022  Page 3 of 9  account the organisational structure of Humberside Police, the nature and extent of Humberside Police’s processing of personal data, and to avoid duplication across scope areas. As such, the scope of this audit is unique to Humberside Police.   It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area(s):  Scope area Description Governance and Accountability The extent to which information governance accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor data protection compliance with Part 3 of the DPA18 and other national data protection legislation are in place and in operation throughout the organisation. Information Security There are appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of manually and electronically processed personal data.  Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are normally a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, on-site visits including interviews with selected staff, and an inspection of selected records.  However, due to the outbreak of Covid -19, and the resulting restrictions on travel, this methodology was no longer appropriate. Therefore, HP agreed to continue with the audit on a remote basis. A desk based review of selected policies and procedures and remote telephone interviews were conducted from 26 April 2022 to 28 April 2022 the ICO would like to thank HP for its flexibility and commitment to the audit during difficult and challenging circumstances.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with data protection legislation. In order to assist HP in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. Humberside Police – ICO Data Protection Audit Executive Summary – May 2022  Page 4 of 9  The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. HP’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified.

Review and Update Information Governance (IG) policies and procedural guidance, including a Data Protection (DP) policy and Records Management (RM) policy that outline HPs approach to DP, Information Security (IS) personal data breaches (PDBs) and data sharing.  Review the Appropriate Policy Document (APD) to include HPs procedures for complying with the DP principles in its processing of personal data under Part 3 of the DPA18.  Develop and document an IG training programme instigated by a Training Needs Analysis (TNA) for all staff. The training should be regularly refreshed and include a programme of specialist training for IG and IS roles. Review all contracts with data processors to ensure there is a process for reporting and responding to a Personal Data Breach (PDB).  Complete HP’s information audit/data mapping exercise to incorporate all business areas across the force. The information audit/data mapping should inform HP’s Record of Processing (ROPA)/Information Asset Register (IAR) to comply with Article 30 UKGDPR and s.61 DPA18 legislation. The ROPA/IAR should fully record the lawful basis for processing personal data including special category and sensitive processing of data. A programme of risk-based IG audits should be developed to include areas of IG such as Records Management, Personal Data Breaches as well as Information Security as part of an internal audit plan. The programme of audits can support monitoring of staff compliance with DP policies and procedures.    Humberside Police – ICO Data Protection Audit Executive Summary – May 2022  Page 9 of 9  Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
