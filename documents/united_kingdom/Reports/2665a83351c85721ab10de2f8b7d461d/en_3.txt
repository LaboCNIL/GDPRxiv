Department of Justice (NI)  Freedom of Information audit report    October 2020    Department of Justice (NI) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – October 2020  Page 2 of 7   Executive summary  Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with data protection legislation, as well as the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) and Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). Section 47 of the FOIA provides provision for the Commissioner to assess whether a public authority is following good practice, including compliance with the requirements of this Act and the provisions of the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and Department of Justice (DoJ) with an independent assurance of the extent to which the information handling practices of DoJ, within the scope of this agreed audit, conform with the codes of practices under sections 45 and 46 of the FOIA.  DoJ agreed to a consensual audit by the ICO of its compliance with the FOIA. An introductory telephone meeting was held on 01 September 2020 with representatives of DoJ to discuss the scope of the audit.  It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area(s):  Scope area Description Freedom of Information The extent to which the information handling practices of DoJ, within the scope of this agreed audit, conform with the codes of practices under sections 45 and 46 of the FOIA.     Department of Justice (NI) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – October 2020  Page 3 of 7   Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are normally a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, on-site visits including interviews with selected staff, and an inspection of selected records.  However, due to the outbreak of Covid-19, and the resulting restrictions on travel, this methodology was no longer appropriate. Therefore DoJ agreed to continue with the audit on a remote basis. A desk based review of selected policies and procedures and remote telephone interviews were conducted from 21 September to 7 October 2020. The ICO would like to thank DoJ for its flexibility and commitment to the audit during difficult and challenging circumstances.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with the relevant legislation. In order to assist DoJ in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. DoJ’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified.  Audit Summary  Audit Scope area Assurance  Rating Overall Opinion Freedom of Information HIGH There is a high level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering data protection compliance. The audit has identified only limited scope for improvement in existing arrangements and as such it is not anticipated that significant further action is required to reduce the risk of non-compliance with the relevant legislation.  *The assurance ratings above are reflective of the remote audit methodology deployed at this time and the rating may not necessarily represent a comprehensive assessment of compliance.   Department of Justice (NI) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – October 2020  Page 4 of 7   Priority Recommendations      0242Freedom of InformationAll scope areasBreakdown of priority recommendationsLowMediumHighUrgent Department of Justice (NI) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – October 2020  Page 5 of 7   Graphs and Charts      79%11%6%4%Freedom of Information Assurance Rating SummaryHighReasonableLimitedVery Limited Department of Justice (NI) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – October 2020  Page 6 of 7   Areas for Improvement  • The DoJ should review their FOI and Records Management policies and procedures and ensure they are up to date and reflect the needs of the department in relation to the legislation.  • The DoJ should incorporate their agencies within the current quality assurance process to ensure consistency in the department’s responses to FOI requests.  • The DoJ should implement FOI and Records Management training that should include induction and refresher training programmes and completion rates should also be tracked and reported to senior management.              Department of Justice (NI) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – October 2020  Page 7 of 7   Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
