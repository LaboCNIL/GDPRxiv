Department for Infrastructure (NI)  Freedom of Information audit report  December 2020   Department for Infrastructure (NI) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – December 2020  Page 2 of 7   Executive summary  Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with data protection legislation, as well as the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) and Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). Section 47 of the FOIA provides provision for the Commissioner to assess whether a public authority is following good practice, including compliance with the requirements of this Act and the provisions of the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and Department for Infrastructure (DfI)  with an independent assurance of the extent to which the information handling practices of DfI, within the scope of this agreed audit, conform with the codes of practices under sections 45 and 46 of the FOIA.  DfI agreed to a consensual audit by the ICO of its compliance with the FOIA. An introductory telephone meeting was held on 22 October 2020 with representatives of DfI to discuss the scope of the audit.  It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area(s):  Scope area Description Freedom of Information The extent to which the information handling practices of DfI, within the scope of this agreed audit, conform with the codes of practices under sections 45 and 46 of the FOIA.     Department for Infrastructure (NI) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – December 2020  Page 3 of 7   Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are normally a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, on-site visits including interviews with selected staff, and an inspection of selected records.  However, due to the outbreak of Covid-19, and the resulting restrictions on travel, this methodology was no longer appropriate. Therefore DfI agreed to continue with the audit on a remote basis. A desk based review of selected policies and procedures and remote telephone interviews were conducted from 9 December to 10 December 2021. The ICO would like to thank DfI for its flexibility and commitment to the audit during difficult and challenging circumstances.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with the relevant legislation. In order to assist DfI in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. DfI’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified.  Audit Summary  Audit Scope area Assurance Rating Overall Opinion Freedom of Information REASONABLE There is a reasonable level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering freedom of information compliance. The audit has identified some scope for improvement in existing arrangements to reduce the risk of non-compliance with the relevant legislation.  *The assurance ratings above are reflective of the remote audit methodology deployed at this time and the rating may not necessarily represent a comprehensive assessment of compliance.   Department for Infrastructure (NI) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – December 2020  Page 4 of 7    Priority Recommendations      71062Freedom of InformationAll scope areasBreakdown of priority recommendationsLowMediumHighUrgent Department for Infrastructure (NI) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – December 2020  Page 5 of 7   Graphs and Charts      43%23%19%15%Freedom of Information Assurance Rating SummaryHighReasonableLimitedVery Limited Department for Infrastructure (NI) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – December 2020  Page 6 of 7   Areas for Improvement  • DfI launched new FOI/EIR and Records Management refresher training on 10 December 2020, and at the time of reporting there was no assurance that this training has been completed by all staff. DfI should ensure that all staff have completed this new training within a set timeframe.  • There is a backlog of physical records ready for disposal or archiving to the Public Records Office NI (PRONI). DfI should continue the work it started pre Covid-19 to sort, review and where necessary securely dispose of these physical records.  • FOI/ EIR requests are reviewed at director level prior to being sent, however there are concerns about the level of training staff have had to appropriately apply exceptions, exemptions and redactions.  • Whilst DfI has delegated ownership for retention and disposal of documents to Information Asset Owners (IAOs) for each team, the IAOs have not received regular records management training.      Department for Infrastructure (NI) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – December 2020  Page 7 of 7   Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
