Freedom of Information audit report   Department of Health (Northern Ireland) February 2021  Department of Health (Northern Ireland) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – February 2021   Executive summary Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with data protection legislation, as well as the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) and Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). Section 47 of the FOIA provides provision for the Commissioner to assess whether a public authority is following good practice, including compliance with the requirements of this Act and the provisions of the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and the Department of Health (DoH) with an independent assurance of the extent to which the information handling practices of DoH, within the scope of this agreed audit, conform with the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46 of the FOIA.  DoH agreed to a consensual audit by the ICO of its compliance with the FOIA. An introductory telephone meeting was held on the 5 October 2020 with representatives of DoH to discuss the scope of the audit.  It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area(s):  Scope Area Description Freedom of Information (FOI) The extent to which the information handling practices of DoH, within the scope of this agreed audit, conform with the codes of practice under sections 45 and 46 of the FOIA.     Department of Health (Northern Ireland) – ICO Freedom of Information Audit Report – February 2021   Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are normally a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, on-site visits including interviews with selected staff, and an inspection of selected records.  However, due to the outbreak of Covid-19, and the resulting restrictions on travel, this methodology was no longer appropriate. Therefore, DoH agreed to continue with the audit on a remote basis. A desk-based review of selected policies and procedures and remote telephone interviews were conducted from 2 February 2021 to 12 February 2021. The ICO would like to thank DoH for its flexibility and commitment to the audit during difficult and challenging circumstances.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with the relevant legislation. In order to assist DoH in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. DoHs priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified.  Audit Summary*  *The assurance ratings above are reflective of the remote audit methodology deployed at this time and the rating may not necessarily represent a comprehensive assessment of compliance. Audit Scope Area Assurance Rating Overall opinionFreedom of Information REASONABLEThere is a reasonable level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering freedome of information compliance.
