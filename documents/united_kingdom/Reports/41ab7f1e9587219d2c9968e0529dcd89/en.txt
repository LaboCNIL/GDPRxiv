Experian Limited Data protection audit report Executive Summary Onsite audit: September 2018 Published: October 2020 ICO. Information Commissioner's Office 1. Background 1.1 The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA18) and other data protection legislation. Section 146 of the DPA18 provides the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) with the power to conduct compulsory audits through the issue of assessment notices. 1.2 Experian obtains, processes and shares personal data in service of its three main lines of business; as a credit reference agency (CRA), as a fraud prevention agency, and for marketing services. 1.3 As a result of data protection concerns raised in other data broker investigations, the Information Commissioner issued an assessment notice to Experian in July 2018 concerning the processing of data for the following purposes: • direct marketing, • lead generation, • data broking, • personal data pooling, enhancing, enriching, matching, appending, profiling, screening, licensing or selling for any of the above purposes 1.4 In November 2018, Privacy International issued a complaint to the Information Commissioner concerning the processing of personal data by Experian for marketing purposes. The complaint was wide­ranging, covering alleged failures to comply with the data protection principles and individual rights contained in the GDPR. Although our audit work predated this complaint, there is significant overlap between the complaint and our existing work, so for the avoidance of doubt this report also comprises our response to the Privacy International complaint. 1.5 The audit field work was undertaken at the Experian office at The Sir John Peace Building, Experian Way, NG2 Business Park, Nottingham, NG80 lZZ between 25 and 28 September 2018.

Scope of the audit 2.1 As per the assessment notice, this audit focuses on Experian's offline marketing services and addressed the following data protection risk areas: • Fairness and transparency • Lawful basis for processing • Data protection by design and default • Creation, maintenance and accuracy of records • Managing data supply, data enrichment and licensing • Data subject rights (not including subject access requests) • Compliance and assurance 2.2 The services in the scope of this audit are characterised as data broking for direct marketing purposes. The ICO has adopted the following definition of data broking: "'data broking" refers to the practice of obtaining information about individuals and trading, including by licensing, this information or information derived from it as products or services to other organisations or individuals. Information about individuals is often aggregated from multiple sources, or otherwise enhanced, to build individual profiles.' 2.3 Experian collected personal data from third party suppliers, the open electoral register and publicly available data. Experian used the data to build datasets that they licensed to a comparatively large number of clients and resellers, who themselves further licensed the data. The datasets enabled organisations to find new prospective customers and/or to enrich existing or potential customer data with socio-demographic attributes. Experian also operated data pools with partner organisations. Credit reference data was used for limited purposes to confirm and trace addresses for marketing and to screen out individuals from marketing campaigns. This was based on elements of their credit reference files which might indicate affordability concerns. Experian also used personal data to create aggregated and anonymous profiling models which could be applied at postcode level, which it licensed to assist clients with their marketing. !CO data protection audit report Executive Summary -Experian 3 of 5 3. Audit Approach 3.1 The audit was conducted following the Information Commissioner's data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, on-site visits including interviews with selected staff, and an inspection of selected records. 3.2 The purpose of the audit was to provide the Information Commissioner with an assurance of the extent to which Experian, within the scope of this audit, was complying with the GDPR and DPA18. 3.4 The ICO's intention, at the start of the audit process, was to follow our established procedure of making recommendations to address identified weakness and seek a management response. 3.5 However, as we compiled the report and considered the evidence supplied concerning Experian's marketing activities, we were concerned about significant failures to comply with key aspects of the data protection legislation, such that it would not be appropriate to merely issue recommendations that Experian adjusts its processing. 3.6 Accordingly, a Preliminary Enforcement Notice was issued to Equifax in April 2019. A preliminary enforcement notice outlines to an controller that the Commissioner is minded to issue an enforcement notice in respect of her concerns, and sets out the action she intends to require of them. The controller is invited to make representations to the Commissioner on the contents of the notice and proposed remedial actions before a final decision is made on serving the notice. On the basis of Experian's representations, Experian's actions to resolve identified issues and subsequent substantial discussions, a revised Dra� Enforcement Notice was issued to Experian in April 2020. 3.7 Although progress has been made by Experian in relation to a number of areas of concern, there remain other areas in which agreement has not been reached. The Commissioner has therefore decided it is necessary to issue an Enforcement Notice in order to resolve those issues. The Enforcement Notice outlines all the remaining areas of concern and includes the required remedial action. 3.8 The summary of key areas for improvement and of good practice given below are those areas that we identified at the time of the audit in 2018. We have indicated where those concerns have been resolved since 2018. For a summary of the ICO's outstanding concerns, please see the Enforcement Notice.

Summary of audit findings Areas for improvement Experian failed to provide sufficient transparency information to a large number of data subjects whose data was gathered into their marketing services. The existing mechanisms for providing this information were insufficient to meet Experian's obligations under the transparency, fairness and lawfulness principle or Article 14. Experian used credit bureau-derived personal data for limited direct marketing purposes. Credit data was not sold in bulk for these purposes, but was used to verify that address details were correct, to screen individuals out of marketing if their data suggested they might struggle to afford the product or service, and to build anonymised geodemographic models. This was against the reasonable expectations of individuals and in breach of the transparency, fairness and lawfulness principle. Experian failed to provide convincing evidence that it had a lawful basis for processing personal data for its marketing purposes. Legitimate interest assessments, whilst in evidence, were not persuasive in their objectivity, and in some cases data that was collected by a third party on the basis of consent was processed by Experian on the basis of its legitimate interests, which undermines the specific and informed nature of consent. The systems for recording and applying requests by data subject rights to exercise their rights, particularly the right to object to direct marketing, were improperly implemented. [The Commissioner is satisfied that this has been rectified since the time of the audit] Areas of good practice Experian evidenced a GDPR-readiness programme that, whilst failing to address the matters noted above, did improve the previous processing operations, including requiring more of data suppliers and terminating contracts with organisations not willing to comply. Also notwithstanding the points above, the governance framework within Experian was mature and well-established; documentary evidence was available on any given point, along with evidence of internal consultation with key stakeholders. !CO data protection audit report Executive Summary -Experian 5 of 5
