Central and North West London  NHS Foundation Trust  Data protection audit report  June 2021    Central and North West London NHS FT – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – June 2021  Page 2 of 9   Executive summary  Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA18) and other data protection legislation. Section 146 of the DPA18 provides the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with the power to conduct compulsory audits through the issue of assessment notices. Section 129 of the DPA18 allows the ICO to carry out consensual audits. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust) with an independent assurance of the extent to which the Trust within the scope of this agreed audit, is complying with data protection legislation.  The scope areas covered by this audit are determined following a risk based analysis of the Trust processing of personal data.  The scope may take into account any data protection issues or risks which are specific to the Trust, identified from ICO intelligence or the Trust own concerns, and/or any data protection issues or risks which affect their specific sector or organisations more widely. The ICO has further tailored the controls covered in each scope area to take into account the organisational structure of the Trust, the nature and extent of the Trust’s processing of personal data, and to avoid duplication across scope areas. As such, the scope of this audit is unique to the Trust.   Central and North West London NHS FT – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – June 2021  Page 3 of 9   It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area(s):  Scope area Description  Governance and Accountability The extent to which information governance accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor data protection compliance to both the UKUK GDPR and national data protection legislation are in place and in operation throughout the organisation.   Cyber Security The extent to which the organisation has technical and organisational measures in place to protect personal data from external and internal attacks on confidentiality, integrity and availability.   Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are normally a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, on-site visits including interviews with selected staff, and an inspection of selected records.  However, due to the outbreak of Covid -19, and the resulting restrictions on travel, this methodology was no longer appropriate. Therefore the Trust agreed to continue with the audit on a remote basis. A desk based review of selected policies and procedures and remote telephone interviews were conducted from 26 April to 30 April 2021 The ICO would like to thank the Trust for its flexibility and commitment to the audit during difficult and challenging circumstances.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with data protection legislation. In order to assist the Trust in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address.  Central and North West London NHS FT – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – June 2021  Page 4 of 9   The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. The Trust’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified.

A comprehensive data mapping exercise should be undertaken, and a formal Record of Processing Activity (ROPA) created, which conforms to all the requirements set out in Article 30 of the UK GDPR.  • The provision of privacy information on the Trust’s public website requires improvement, as there are currently two sections where privacy information is carried, a page called 'Your information' and a separate 'Fair Processing Notice'.  Although they cover some of the same areas, there are some sections included on one but not the other, which could prevent data subjects finding all the information required in privacy information under Articles 13 and 14 of the UK GDPR. Furthermore, the correct information regarding how to make a subject access request should be available on the website for data subjects.  • The Information Governance structure in the Trust requires strengthening to provide assurance that the DPO is able to carry out their role in an appropriately effective manner as required by data protection legislation.      Central and North West London NHS FT – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – June 2021  Page 8 of 9   Cyber Security   • Awareness needs to be raised among staff of social engineering and the risk it can pose to the protection of personal data and cyber security. In addition, there is a lack of awareness of what staff are expected to do in the event that they fall victim to a suspected social engineering attack.   • Mobile device management should be improved, as it is possible for staff to download instant messenger apps onto a Trust mobile device, and there is also limited oversight of which members of staff have access to and are using instant messenger apps.      Best Practice   There is a Privacy by Design Policy in force which helps reinforce the culture of privacy awareness within the organisation.     Central and North West London NHS FT – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – June 2021  Page 9 of 9    Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
