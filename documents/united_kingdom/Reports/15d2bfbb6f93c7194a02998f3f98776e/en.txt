Gloucestershire County Council Data protection audit report October 2020  Gloucestershire County Council – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – October 2020   Executive summary Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA18) and other data protection legislation. Section 146 of the DPA18 provides the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with the power to conduct compulsory audits through the issue of assessment notices. Section 129 of the DPA18 allows the ICO to carry out consensual audits. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  Gloucestershire County Council (GCC) agreed to a consensual audit by the ICO of its processing of personal data. An introductory telephone meeting was held on 2 July 2020 with representatives of GCC to discuss the scope of the audit.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and GCC with an independent assurance of the extent to which GCC, within the scope of this agreed audit, is complying with data protection legislation.              Gloucestershire County Council – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – October 2020   It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area(s):  Scope Area Description Governance & Accountability The extent to which information governance accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor data protection compliance to both the GDPR and national data protection legislation are in place and in operation throughout the organisation. Information Security (Security of Personal Data)   There are appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of manually and electronically processed personal data. Freedom of Information (FOI) The extent to which FOI/EIR accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor compliance are in place and in operation throughout the organisation.    Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are normally a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, on-site visits including interviews with selected staff, and an inspection of selected records.  However, due to the outbreak of Covid -19, and the resulting restrictions on travel, this methodology was no longer appropriate. Therefore, GCC agreed to continue with the audit on a remote basis. A desk based review of selected policies and procedures and remote telephone interviews were conducted from 10-27 August 2020. The ICO would like to thank GCC for its flexibility and commitment to the audit during difficult and challenging circumstances.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with data protection legislation. In order to assist GCC in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. GCC’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified.   Gloucestershire County Council – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – October 2020   Audit Summary* Audit Scope Area Audit Scope Area Audit Scope Area Governance & Accountability Reasonable There is a reasonable level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering data protection compliance.

As personal data could potentially be stored on these devices without oversight, this risks compromising effective information management.   • Disaster Recovery plans are not fully documented on a granular level and not all managed applications have been fully tested.  • There is a non-standardised way of promoting FOI through the council, particularly to new starters, and therefore a risk that not all new starters are provided with the level of information they should be.  • GCC are unable to meet statutory timescales for responding to FOI/EIR requests.  • There have been cases where information request responses are designed to meet the requirements of the Council rather than to meet legislation requirements.      Gloucestershire County Council – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – October 2020   Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
