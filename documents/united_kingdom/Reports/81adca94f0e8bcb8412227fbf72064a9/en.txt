Tees, Esk & Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust  Data protection audit report  January 2022 Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – December 2021 Page 2 of 11  Executive summary  Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA18) and other data protection legislation. Section 146 of the DPA18 provides the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with the power to conduct compulsory audits through the issue of assessment notices. Section 129 of the DPA18 allows the ICO to carry out consensual audits.   The ICO is an independent, proportionate regulator and sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach. High standards of personal data protection compliance help organisations innovate and deliver great services by building trust with the public. The ICO’s expertise and consistent approach to regulation provides certainty enabling organisations to feel confident to use personal data responsibly, innovate and support economic growth.  The audit was conducted consensually as part of our ongoing audit strategy.   The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust) with an independent assurance of the extent to which the Trust, within the scope of this agreed audit, is complying with data protection legislation.   Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – December 2021 Page 3 of 11  The scope areas covered by this audit were determined following a risk based analysis of the Trust processing of personal data. The scope may take into account any data protection issues or risks which are specific to the Trust, identified from ICO intelligence or the Trust own concerns, and/or any data protection issues or risks which affect their specific sector or organisations more widely. The ICO has further tailored the controls covered in each scope area to take into account the organisational structure of the Trust, the nature and extent of the Trust processing of personal data, and to avoid duplication across scope areas. As such, the scope of this audit is unique to the Trust.   It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area(s)  Scope area Description Governance & Accountability The extent to which information governance accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor data protection compliance to both the UK GDPR and national data protection legislation are in place and in operation throughout the organisation. Data Sharing The design and operation of controls to ensure the sharing of personal data complies with the principles of all data protection legislation.  Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are normally a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, on-site visits including interviews with selected staff, and an inspection of selected records.  However, due to the outbreak of Covid -19, and the resulting restrictions on travel, this methodology was no longer appropriate. Therefore, the Trust agreed to continue with the audit on a remote basis. A desk based review of selected policies and procedures and remote telephone interviews were conducted from 22 November to 26 November. The ICO would like to thank the Trust for its flexibility and commitment to the audit during difficult and challenging circumstances.   Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – December 2021 Page 4 of 11  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with data protection legislation. In order to assist the Trust in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. The Trust priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified.

What the Trust has in place is more of a data flow map and, whilst this is comprehensive, it does not include all of the requirements of Article 30 of UK GDPR. • The Trust’s DPIA screening questions and template is hard to follow and difficult to complete, this increases the risk of the template being inaccurately completed or not used at all. In addition, the DPIA screening questions do not contain all of the relevant considerations expected, such as the scope, purpose, type, and manner of proposed processing. This makes it difficult to establish the context of the new processing and for the designated reviewer to accurately review it.  Data Sharing: • Not all staff likely to make decisions about data sharing have been identified and made aware of their responsibilities, and there is a lack of specialised training provided to staff with data sharing responsibilities both at induction as well as through periodic refresher training. • The Trust’s Information Sharing Agreement (ISA) library is not up to date and not all routine data sharing activities are covered by a sufficiently detailed ISA signed by the senior management of all sharing partners.  • Existing ISAs are not reviewed periodically, in all cases, to provide assurance that each agreement continues to operate as intended and in line with legislative requirements. The Data Performance and Assurance Group (DPAG) does not have sufficient oversight of ISA reviews as they do not feature as a standing agenda item at the DPAG’s meetings.  • Sufficiently detailed policies, procedures and guidance are not in place to ensure that all staff that handle ad hoc third party disclosure requests can do so in a lawful, effective, and consistent manner. Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – December 2021 Page 10 of 11  Credits  ICO Audit Team ICO Team Manager – Julie Wood ICO Engagement Lead Auditor – Harry Evans ICO Lead Auditor – Ben Gnatiuk  Thanks The ICO would like to thank Louise Eastham, Head of IG and DPO for their help in the audit engagement.
