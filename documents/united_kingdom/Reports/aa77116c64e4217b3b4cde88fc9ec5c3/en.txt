Blackpool Council    Data protection audit report   April 2021    Blackpool Council - ICO Data Protection Audit Report – April 2021  Executive summary  Audit Methodology  The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA18) and other data protection legislation. Section 146 of the DPA18 provides the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with the power to conduct compulsory audits through the issue of assessment notices. Section 129 of the DPA18 allows the ICO to carry out consensual audits. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  Blackpool Council (BC) agreed to a consensual audit by the ICO of its processing of personal data. An introductory telephone meeting was held on 22 February 2021 with representatives of BC to discuss the scope of the audit.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and BC with an independent assurance of the extent to which BC, within the scope of this agreed audit, is complying with data protection legislation.    Blackpool Council - ICO Data Protection Audit Report – April 2021  It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area(s):  Scope Area Description Governance & Accountability The extent to which information governance accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor data protection compliance to both the GDPR and national data protection legislation are in place and in operation throughout the organisation. Information Security (Security of Personal Data) There are appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of manually and electronically processed personal data. Freedom of Information (FOI) The extent to which FOI accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor compliance are in place and in operation throughout the organisation.    Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are normally a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, on-site visits including interviews with selected staff, and an inspection of selected records.  However, due to the outbreak of Covid-19, and the resulting restrictions on travel, this methodology was no longer appropriate. Therefore, BC agreed to continue with the audit on a remote basis. A desk based review of selected policies and procedures and remote telephone interviews were conducted from 20 April 2021 to 22 April 2021. The ICO would like to thank BC for its flexibility and commitment to the audit during difficult and challenging circumstances.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with data protection legislation. In order to assist BC in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. BC’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified. Blackpool Council - ICO Data Protection Audit Report – April 2021  Audit Summary*  Audit Scope area Assurance Rating Overall Opinion Governance & Accountability High  There is a high level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering data protection compliance.
