Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust  Data protection audit report  September 2021    Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust – Executive Summary – September 2021  Page 2 of 10  Executive summary  Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA18) and other data protection legislation. Section 146 of the DPA18 provides the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with the power to conduct compulsory audits through the issue of assessment notices. Section 129 of the DPA18 allows the ICO to carry out consensual audits. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust) agreed to a consensual audit of the data protection practices in October 2020.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and the Trust with an independent assurance of the extent to which the Trust, within the scope of this agreed audit, is complying with data protection legislation.  The scope areas covered by this audit are determined following a risk-based analysis of the Trust’s processing of personal data.  The scope may take into account any data protection issues or risks which affect their specific sector or organisations more widely. The ICO has further tailored the controls covered in each scope area to take into account the organisational structure of the Trust, the nature and extent of the Trust’s processing of personal data, and to avoid duplication across scope areas. As such, the scope of this audit is unique to the Trust. Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust – Executive Summary – September 2021  Page 3 of 10  It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area(s)  Scope area Description Governance & Accountability The extent to which information governance accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor data protection compliance to both the UKGDPR and national data protection legislation are in place and in operation throughout the organisation.  Data Sharing The design and operation of controls to ensure the sharing of personal data complies with the principles of all data protection legislation.    Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are normally a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, on-site visits including interviews with selected staff, and an inspection of selected records.  However, due to the outbreak of Covid -19, and the resulting restrictions on travel, this methodology was no longer appropriate. Therefore the Trust agreed to continue with the audit on a remote basis. A desk based review of selected policies and procedures and remote telephone interviews were conducted from 10 to 13 August. The ICO would like to thank the Trust for its flexibility and commitment to the audit during difficult and challenging circumstances.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with data protection legislation. In order to assist the Trust in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust – Executive Summary – September 2021  Page 4 of 10  The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. The Trust’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified.  Audit Summary  Audit Scope area Assurance Rating Overall Opinion Governance & Accountability Reasonable There is a reasonable level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering data protection compliance. The audit has identified some scope for improvement in existing arrangements to reduce the risk of non-compliance with data protection legislation.

The Trust should also work on raising the profile of the DPO across the organisation and ensure that he is reporting to the highest level of management.  • The Trust needs to work on formalising their risk management system by appointing Information Asset Owners and Information Asset Administrators across the Trust. These roles should be provided with specialised training which should be refreshed when required. • The Trust’s legacy systems should be checked to ensure compliance with data protection legislation through completing Data Protection Impact Assessments where required.  Data Sharing  • The Trust should improve the governance and oversight of information sharing within the Trust by ensuring there is an appropriately documented high level information sharing policy or procedure. This should set out the responsibilities for information sharing and provide links to the relevant guidance, procedures and templates which are approved by senior management. This will help ensure that information sharing has been adequately embedded within the Trust’s Information Assurance Framework.  Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust – Executive Summary – September 2021  Page 9 of 10  • The Trust should work on seeking further assurances from information sharing partners with regards to meeting the requirements of the legislation, as there is currently insufficient information within the Data Sharing agreements to explain how undertakings will be met.                 Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust – Executive Summary – September 2021  Page 10 of 10  Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
