Merseyside Police  Data protection audit report  August 2021    Merseyside Police – ICO Data Protection Audit Executive Summary – August 2021  Page 2 of 10  Executive summary  Audit Methodology The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA18) and other data protection legislation. Section 146 of the DPA18 provides the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with the power to conduct compulsory audits through the issue of assessment notices. Section 129 of the DPA18 allows the ICO to carry out consensual audits. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  Merseyside Police (MP) agreed to a consensual audit of its processing of personal data. An introductory telephone meeting was held on 14 April 2021 with representatives of MP to discuss the scope of the audit.   The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and MP with an independent assurance of the extent to which MP, within the scope of this agreed audit, is complying with data protection legislation.  The scope areas covered by this audit are determined following a risk based analysis of MPs processing of personal data.  The scope may take into account any data protection issues or risks which are specific to MP, identified from ICO intelligence or MPs own concerns, and/or any data protection issues or risks which affect their specific sector or organisations more widely. The ICO has further tailored the controls covered in each scope area to take into account the organisational structure of MP, the nature and extent of MPs processing of personal data, and to avoid duplication across scope areas. As such, the scope of this audit is unique to MP.      Merseyside Police – ICO Data Protection Audit Executive Summary – August 2021  Page 3 of 10  It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area(s)  Scope area Description Governance and Accountability The extent to which information governance accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor data protection compliance with Part 3 of the DPA18 and other national data protection legislation are in place and in operation throughout the organisation. Records Management The extent to which processes are in place for managing both electronic and manual records containing personal data. This will include controls in place to monitor the creation, maintenance, storage, movement, retention and destruction of personal data records. Personal Data Breach Management and Reporting The extent to which the organisation has measures in place to detect, assess and respond to security breaches involving personal data, to record them appropriately and notify the supervisory authority and individuals where appropriate.  Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are normally a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, on-site visits including interviews with selected staff, and an inspection of selected records.  However, due to the outbreak of Covid-19, and the resulting restrictions on travel, this methodology was no longer appropriate. Therefore MP agreed to continue with the audit on a remote basis. A pre-audit survey was drafted by ICO Auditors and agreed by MP and launched to MP staff between 28 May and closed on 28 June. The ICO would like to thank MP for its flexibility and commitment to the audit during difficult and challenging circumstances.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with data protection legislation. In order to assist MP in implementing the recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. MPs priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified.  Merseyside Police – ICO Data Protection Audit Executive Summary – August 2021  Page 4 of 10   Appendix Two contains the results of the pre-audit survey. MP should use the results of the survey to inform their  Information Governance (IG) training and awareness programme.  Audit Summary  Audit Scope area Assurance Rating Overall Opinion Governance and Accountability Limited There is a limited level of assurance that processes and procedures are in place and are delivering data protection compliance.

Producing guidance for individuals and staff would assist in handling requests for rectification and erasure of personal data. It will also help MP inform third parties to which that data was shared. Review the Appropriate Policy Document (APD) to include MPs procedures for complying with the DP principles in its processing of personal data under Part 3 of the DPA18.  Design and document an IG training programme instigated by a Training Needs Analysis (TNA) for all staff. The training should be regularly refreshed and  include a programme of specialist training for IG roles. Review all contracts with third party organisations who process personal information on behalf of MP to identify MPs data processors. Where a processor is used, an appropriate contract should be put in place that includes arrangements for reporting and responding to a PDB.  The completion of an information audit/data mapping exercise would ensure that all data processors are clearly identified and create both a complete Record of Processing Activities (RoPA) and Information Asset Register (IAR), to incorporate all business areas across MP. The exercise is key to comply with Article 30 UK GDPR and s.61 DPA18 legislation and establishing the lawful basis for processing personal data, special categories and sensitive processing of data.  To ensure that manual and electronic records containing personal data are appropriately accessed, classified, stored, weeded and disposed of, MP should document formal RM policies and procedures including sharing personal data with third parties across all areas of MP.  Tightening procedures around staff transferring roles within MP will assist with access control and ensuring staff only have access to systems and areas containing personal data that they are authorised to.   Merseyside Police – ICO Data Protection Audit Executive Summary – August 2021  Page 9 of 10  Identify and document a set criteria for assessing the severity of PDB and the likely effect on individual's rights and freedoms. This guidance should reference risk assessment guidance and provide particular information on how to assess a 'high risk' to affected individuals. MP should develop a process and guidance for staff to follow when notifying individuals of a PDB. For law enforcement processing, where the provision of information about the breach is restricted wholly or partly, the procedure should ensure that the restriction is applied appropriately and consistently with the decision to restrict the provision of the information documented.   Merseyside Police – ICO Data Protection Audit Executive Summary – August 2021  Page 10 of 10  Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
