Nottingham University   Hospitals NHS Trust Data protection audit report November 2020  Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – November 2020  2   Executive summary Audit Methodology  The Information Commissioner is responsible for enforcing and promoting compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA18) and other data protection legislation. Section 146 of the DPA18 provides the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with the power to conduct compulsory audits through the issue of assessment notices. Section 129 of the DPA18 allows the ICO to carry out consensual audits. The ICO sees auditing as a constructive process with real benefits for controllers and so aims to establish a participative approach.  The purpose of the audit is to provide the Information Commissioner and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (the Trust) with an independent assurance of the extent to which the Trust within the scope of this agreed audit, is complying with data protection legislation.          Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – November 2020  3   It was agreed that the audit would focus on the following area(s):  Scope Area Description Governance and Accountability  The extent to which information governance accountability, policies and procedures, performance measurement controls, and reporting mechanisms to monitor data protection compliance to both the GDPR and national data protection legislation are in place and in operation throughout the organisation.   Data Sharing  The design and operation of controls to ensure the sharing of personal data complies with the principles of all data protection legislation.     Audits are conducted following the Information Commissioner’s data protection audit methodology. The key elements of this are normally a desk-based review of selected policies and procedures, on-site visits including interviews with selected staff, and an inspection of selected records.  However, due to the outbreak of Covid -19, and the resulting restrictions on travel, this methodology was no longer appropriate. Therefore The Trust agreed to continue with the audit on a remote basis. A desk based review of selected policies and procedures and remote telephone interviews were conducted from 28 September to 8 October 2020. The ICO would like to thank the Trust for its flexibility and commitment to the audit during difficult and challenging circumstances.  Where weaknesses were identified recommendations have been made, primarily around enhancing existing processes to facilitate compliance with data protection legislation. In order to assist the Trust in implementing the  Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – November 2020  4   recommendations each has been assigned a priority rating based upon the risks that they are intended to address. The ratings are assigned based upon the ICO’s assessment of the risks involved. The Trust’s priorities and risk appetite may vary and, therefore, they should undertake their own assessments of the risks identified.

Data Sharing • Not all data sharing agreements (DSAs) contain sufficient detail and procedures to provide adequate direction to each party and thereby ensure that the requirements of the legislation are met.   Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – November 2020  8   • The Trust needs to put in place a formal review process for existing data sharing agreements to mitigate risks of unlawful sharing.  • Ongoing evidence should be obtained by the Trust to provide assurance that the access controls agreed with sharing partners are being implemented as arranged.  • The Trust should ensure that there is in place a consistent process to evidence that the deletion of shared data is being undertaken by third parties in data sharing in line with contractual agreements.   Best Practice  The Trust makes exemplar copies of good practice in completing DPIAs available on the Information Governance pages of the Trust Intranet.    Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust – ICO Data Protection Audit Report – November 2020  9   Disclaimer The matters arising in this report are only those that came to our attention during the course of the audit and are not necessarily a comprehensive statement of all the areas requiring improvement.
