The notice isbeing issued because of a serious contravention of regulation 21 of thePrivacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003(“PECR”).2.This notice explains the Commissioner’s decision.  Legal framework 3.HSSL, whose registered office is given above (Companies HouseRegistration Number: 11389563) is the organisation stated in thisnotice to have used a public electronic communications service for thepurpose of making unsolicited calls for the purposes of direct marketingcontrary to regulation 21 of PECR.                                                                                                                                    2  4. Regulation 21 applies to the making of unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes. It means that if a company wants to make calls promoting a product or service to an individual who has a telephone number which is registered with the Telephone Preference Service Ltd (“TPS”), then that individual must have notified the company that they do not object to receiving such calls from it.  5. Regulation 21 paragraph (1) of PECR provides that:  “(1) A person shall neither use, nor instigate the use of, a public electronic communications service for the purposes of making unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes where-  (a) the called line is that of a subscriber who has previously notified the caller that such calls should not for the time being be made on that line; or  (b) the number allocated to a subscriber in respect of the called line is one listed in the register kept under regulation 26.”  6. Regulation 21 paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (5) provide that:         “(2)   A subscriber shall not permit his line to be used in contravention    of paragraph (1).  (3)   A person shall not be held to have contravened paragraph (1)(b) where the number allocated to the called line has been listed on the register for less than 28 days preceding that on which the call is made.                                                                                                                                      3  (4)  Where a subscriber who has caused a number allocated to a line of his to be listed in the register kept under regulation 26 has notified a caller that he does not, for the time being, object to such calls being made on that line by that caller, such calls may be made by that caller on that line, notwithstanding that the number allocated to that line is listed in the said register.          (5) Where a subscriber has given a caller notification pursuant to paragraph (4) in relation to a line of his—  (a) the subscriber shall be free to withdraw that notification at any time, and (b) where such notification is withdrawn, the caller shall not make such calls on that line.”  7. Under regulation 26 of PECR, the Commissioner is required to maintain a register of numbers allocated to subscribers who have notified them that they do not wish, for the time being, to receive unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes on those lines. The Telephone Preference Service Limited (“TPS”) is a limited company which operates the register on the Commissioner’s behalf. Businesses who wish to carry out direct marketing by telephone can subscribe to the TPS for a fee and receive from them monthly a list of numbers on that register.  8. Section 122(5) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA18”) defines direct marketing as “the communication (by whatever means) of advertising or marketing material which is directed to particular individuals”. This definition also applies for the purposes of PECR (see regulation 2(2) PECR and paragraphs 430 & 432(6) to Schedule 19 of the DPA18).                                                                                                                                      4  9. “Individual” is defined in regulation 2(1) of PECR as “a living individual and includes an unincorporated body of such individuals”.  10. A “subscriber” is defined in regulation 2(1) of PECR as “a person who is a party to a contract with a provider of public electronic communications services for the supply of such services”.  11. The DPA contains enforcement provisions at Part V which are exercisable by the Commissioner. Those provisions are modified and extended for the purposes of PECR by Schedule 1 PECR.  12. Section 40(1)(a) of the DPA (as extended and modified by PECR) provides that if the Commissioner is satisfied that a person has contravened or is contravening any of the requirements of the Regulations, he may serve him with an Enforcement Notice requiring him to take within such time as may be specified in the Notice, or to refrain from taking after such time as may be so specified, such steps as are so specified.   13. PECR were enacted to protect the individual’s fundamental right to privacy in the electronic communications sector. PECR were subsequently amended and strengthened. The Commissioner will interpret PECR in a way which is consistent with the Regulations’ overall aim of ensuring high levels of protection for individuals’ privacy rights.  14. The provisions of the DPA remain in force for the purposes of PECR notwithstanding the introduction of the DPA18: see paragraph 58(1) of Schedule 20 to the DPA18.          The contravention                                                                                                                                      5  15. The Commissioner finds that HSSL contravened regulation 21 of PECR.   16. The Commissioner finds that the contravention was as follows:  17. Between 3 March 2020 and 30 September 2020, HSSL used a public telecommunications service for the purposes of making 229,483 unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes to subscribers where the number allocated to the subscriber in respect of the called line was a number listed on the register of numbers kept by the Commissioner in accordance with regulation 26, contrary to regulation 21(1)(b) of PECR.   18. The Commissioner is also satisfied for the purposes of regulation 21 that these 229,483 unsolicited direct marketing calls were made to subscribers who had registered with the TPS at least 28 days prior to receiving the calls, and who for the purposes of regulation 21(4) had not notified HSSL that they did not object to receiving such calls.  19. For such notification to be valid under regulation 21(4), the individual must have taken a clear and positive action to override their TPS registration and indicate their willingness to receive marketing calls from the company. The notification should reflect the individual’s choice about whether or not they are willing to receive marketing calls. Therefore, where signing up to use a product or service is conditional upon receiving marketing calls, companies will need to demonstrate how this constitutes a clear and positive notification of the individual’s willingness to receive such calls.   20. The notification must clearly indicate the individual’s willingness to receive marketing calls specifically. Companies cannot rely on individuals opting in to marketing communications generally, unless it is clear that this will include telephone calls.                                                                                                                                       6   21. Further, the notification must demonstrate the individual’s willingness to receive marketing calls from that company specifically. Notifications will not be valid for the purposes of regulation 21(4) if individuals are asked to agree to receive marketing from “similar organisations”, “partners”, “selected third parties” or other similar generic descriptions.   22. HSSL has failed to provide any evidence that the subscribers had not objected to its unsolicited direct marketing calls, which it made having purchased data from a third-party data provider following mere assurances of veracity. Furthermore, HSSL has failed to provide any satisfactory evidence of due diligence being conducted in respect of the data which it was choosing to purchase. There is no evidence at all before the Commissioner to demonstrate that the individuals who received these unsolicited direct marketing calls from HSSL had provided notification that they did not object to receiving such calls from it. HSSL also failed to conduct any checks of its own against the TPS register.  23. The Commissioner has considered, as he is required to do under section 40(2) of the DPA (as extended and modified by PECR) when deciding whether to serve an Enforcement Notice, whether any contravention has caused or is likely to cause any person damage or distress. The Commissioner has decided that it is likely that damage or distress has been caused in this instance.  24. In view of the matters referred to above the Commissioner hereby gives notice that, in exercise of his powers under section 40 of the DPA, he requires HSSL to take the steps specified in Annex 1 of this Notice.  Right of Appeal                                                                                                                                     7   25. There is a right of appeal against this Notice to the First-tier Tribunal (Information Rights), part of the General Regulatory Chamber. Information about appeals is set out in the attached Annex 2.
