ICO. Information Commissioner's Office DATA PROTECTION ACT 1998 SUPERVISORY POWERS OF THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER ENFORCEMENT NOTICE To: Leads Work Limited Of: Suite C Underwood House, 235 Three Bridges Road, Crawley, West Sussex, RH 10 1 LU 1.The Information Commissioner ("Commissioner") has decided to issueLeads Work Limited ("LWL") with an enforcement notice under section40 of the Data Protection Act 1998 ("DPA"). The notice is in relation toa contravention of Regulation 22 of the Privacy and ElectronicCommunications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ("PECR").2.This notice explains the Commissioner's decision.Legal framework 3.LWL, whose registered office is given above (companies houseregistration number: 10853169), is the organisation (person) stated inthis notice to have transmitted unsolicited communications by meansof electronic mail to individual subscribers for the purposes of directmarketing contrary to regulation 22 of PECR.4.Regulation 22 of PECR provides that:1 ICO. Information Commissioner's Office "(1) This regulation applies to the transmission of unsolicited communications by means of electronic mail to individual subscribers. (2) Except in the circumstances referred to in paragraph (3), a person shall neither transmit, nor instigate the transmission of, unsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing by means of electronic mail unless the recipient of the electronic mail has previously notified the sender that he consents for the time being to such communications being sent by, or at the instigation of, the sender. (3) A person may send or instigate the sending of electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing where -(a) That person has obtained the contact details of the recipient of that electronic mail in the course of the sale or negotiations for the sale of a product or device to that recipient; (b) The direct marketing is in respect of that person's similar products and services only; and ( c) The recipient has been given a simple means of refusing (free of charge except for the costs of transmission of the refusal) the use of his contact details for the purposes of such direct marketing, at the time that the details were initially collected, and, where he did not initially refuse the use of the details, at the time of each subsequent communication. (4) A subscriber shall not permit his line to be used in contravention of paragraph (2)." 5. Section 122(5) of the DPA 2018 defines "direct marketing" as "the communication (by whatever means) of any advertising or marketing 2 ICO. Information Commissioner's Office material which is directed to particular individuals". This definition also applies for the purposes of PECR (see regulation 2(2)). 6. "Electronic mail" is defined in regulation 2(1) PECR as " any text, voice, sound or image sent over a public electronic communications network which can be stored in the network or in the recipient's terminal equipment until it is collected by the recipient and includes messages sent using a short message service". 7. Consent is defined in Article 4(11) the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 as "any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her". 8. The DPA contains enforcement provisions at Part V which are exercisable by the Commissioner. Those provisions are modified and extended for the purposes of PECR by Schedule 1 PECR. 9. Section 40(1)(a) of the DPA (as extended and modified by PECR) provides that if the Commissioner is satisfied that a person has contravened or is contravening any of the requirements of the Regulations, he may serve him with an Enforcement Notice requiring him to take within such time as may be specified in the Notice, or to refrain from taking after such time as may be so specified, such steps as are so specified. 10. The provisions of the DPA remain in force for the purposes of PECR notwithstanding the introduction of the Data Protection Act 2018 (see paragraph 58(1) of part 9, Schedule 20 of that Act). 3 ICO. Information Commissioner's Office The contravention 11. The Commissioner finds that LWL has contravened Regulation 22 of PECR. The Commissioner finds that the contravention was as follows: 12. Between 16 May 2020 and 26 June 2020 LWL transmitted 2,670,140 texts over a public electronic communications network by means of electronic mail to individual subscribers for the purposes of direct marketing contrary to regulation 22 of PECR. 13. Organisations cannot generally send marketing texts unless the recipient has notified the sender that they consent to such texts being sent by, or at the instigation of, that sender. 14. The Commissioner is therefore satisfied that the consent relied on by LWL did not amount to valid consent for the purposes of regulation 22 PECR. 15. The Commissioner is satisfied that LWL was responsible for this contravention. 16. LWL has continued to send marketing texts to individuals without any apparent remedial measures having been taken to prevent further contraventions of Regulation 22. This is evidenced by a further 28,350 complaints received by the 7726 reporting service since August 2020 to the time of this Notice. 17. The Commissioner has considered, as she is required to do under section 40(2) of the DPA (as extended and modified by the Regulations) when deciding whether to serve an Enforcement Notice, whether any contravention has caused or is likely to cause any person 4 ICO. Information Commissioner's Office damage. The Commissioner has decided that it is unlikely that actual damage has been caused in this instance. 18. In view of the matters referred to above the Commissioner hereby gives notice that, in exercise her powers under section 40 of the Act she requires LWL to take the steps as specified in Annex 1 of this Notice. Rights of Appeal 19. There is a right of Appeal against this Notice to the First-Tier Tribunal (Information Rights), part of the General Regulatory Chamber. Information about appeals is set out in the attached Annex 2.
