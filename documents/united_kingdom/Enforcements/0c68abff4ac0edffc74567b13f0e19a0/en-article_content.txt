Hysteroscopy scans were saved on to a series of three USB sticks over a period of nine years from May 2013 until the remaining two encrypted USB sticks became inaccessible on 5 April 2018. It is unknown whether this inaccessibility was as a result of a technical failure of the USBs or human error from inputting the wrong password.
