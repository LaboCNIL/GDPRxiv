The exception reports were to highlight where the work of the RPA could not be completed and manual officer intervention was required in order to complete the necessary work on Interpol circulations. Due to this oversight the exception reports were not actioned and as a result the cancellation of the data subject’s extradition order was not actioned which led to the incorrect arrest of the data subject.
