A motor industry employee has been prosecuted for passing the personal information of service users to an accident claims management firm without authorisation.
Kim Doyle, of Village Lane, Higher Whitley, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to secure unauthorised access to computer data, and to selling unlawfully obtained personal data. She was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court on 8 January 2021 to eight months' imprisonment, suspended for two years.
Doyle unlawfully compiled lists of road traffic accident data including partial names, mobile phone numbers and registration numbers despite having no permission from her employers. Doyle then unlawfully transferred the data she obtained to William Shaw, the director of an accident claims management firm.
William Shaw, of Flixton Road, Urmston, was also sentenced to eight months' imprisonment, suspended for two years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to secure unauthorised access to computer data.
Doyle and Shaw were also each ordered to carry out 100 hours' unpaid work and contribute £1,000 costs.
A Confiscation Order, under the Proceeds of Crimes Act, to recover benefit obtained as a result of the offending had been given by the Court in which Doyle must pay a benefit figure of £25,000 and Shaw must pay a benefit figure of £15,000. Both Doyle and Shaw will face three months' imprisonment if the benefit figures are not paid within three months.
