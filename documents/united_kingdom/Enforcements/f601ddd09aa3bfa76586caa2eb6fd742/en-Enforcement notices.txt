4. 

Regulation 21 applies to the making of unsolicited  calls for direct 

marketing  purposes.  It means  that  if a company wants to  make  calls 

promoting a product or service to  a subscriber  who has  a telephone 

number  which is  registered  with the Telephone Preference Service  Ltd 

("TPS")  or  Corporate Telephone  Preference  Service  ("CTPS"),  then  that 

subscriber must  have notified the company that they do not object to 

receiving such calls from it. 

5. 

Regulation 21(Al} of  PECR provides: 

(Al) A person shall neither 

use, nor instigate 

the use of, a public 

electronic 

communications 

service 

for the purposes 

of making calls 

(whether 

solicited 

or unsolicited) 

for direct marketing 

purposes 

except where that person-

(a) does not prevent presentation 

of the identity 

of the calling 
line 

on the called line; or 

(b) presents 

the identity 

of a line on which  he 

can be contacted. 

6. 

Regulation 21(1) of PECR provides: 

"(1) A person shall neither 

use, nor instigate 

the use of, a public 

electronic 

communications 

service 

for the purposes 

of making 

unsolicited 

calls for 

direct marketing 

purposes 

where-

(a) the called line is that of a subscriber 

who has previously 

notified the 

caller 

that such calls should not for the time 

being 

be made on that line; or 

(b) the number allocated to 

a subscriber 

in respect 

of the called 

line is one listed 

in the register 

kept under regulation 

26."

Regulation 21  paragraphs (2),  (3),  ( 4) and (5) provide that: 

"(2)  A subscriber shall not permit his line to  be used in contravention 

of paragraph (1). 

(3)  A person  shall  not  be  held to  have  contravened  paragraph {1)(b) 

where the number allocated  to the called line has been listed on the 

register for less than 28 days  preceding that on which the call  is 

made. 

(4)  Where a subscriber who  has caused a number allocated to a line of 

his to be listed in the register kept under regulation  26 has notified 

a caller that he does not,  for the time being, object to such  calls 

being  made on that  line  by that caller,  such calls may be made by 

that caller on that line,  notwithstanding that the number allocated 

to that line is listed  in the said  register. 

(5)  Where a subscriber has given  a caller  notification pursuant  to 

paragraph  (4)  in  relation to a  line of his-

(a)  the subscriber shall  be  free to withdraw that  notification  at 

any time,  and 

(b) where  such notification  is  withdrawn,  the caller shall  not 

make such calls on  that line. 11

(b) in relation 

to a communication 

to which  regulation 

21 

or 21A (telephone 

calls) 

applies, 

the particulars 

mentioned in 

paragraph 

(2)(a)  and, 

if the recipient 

of 

the call so requests, 

those mentioned 

in paragraph 

(2)(b). 

(2) The particulars  referred  to 

in paragraph 

(1) are -

(a) 

the name 

of the person; 

(b) either 

the address 

of the person or a telephone 

number on which he can be 

reached free of charge." 

9. 

Under regulation 26 of  PECR, the Commissioner is required to maintain 

a register of numbers allocated to subscribers who have notified them 

that they do  not wish, for the time being,  to receive unsolicited calls for 

direct marketing purposes on  those  lines.  The Telephone Preference 

Service  Limited  ("TPS")  is a limited  company which  operates the 

register on the Commissioner's behalf.  Businesses who wish to  carry 

out direct  marketing by telephone can  subscribe to the TPS for a  fee 

and receive from them  monthly a list of numbers on that register. 

10.  Section  122(5) of the DPA18 defines  direct marketing as "the 

communication 

(by whatever 

means) of any advertising 

material 

which 

is  directed  to 

particular 

individuals". 

This  definition  also applies  for the 

purposes of  PECR  (see  regulation 2(2)  PECR  & Schedule 19  paragraphs 

430  & 432(6)  DPA18).

11. 

"Individual" is defined in regulation  2( 1)  of  PECR as "a  living individual 
and includes an unincorporated body  of such individuals". 

12.  A "subscriber"  is defined in regulation  2(1) of  PECR  as  "a person who is 

a party to a contract with a provider of public electronic 

communications services for the supply of such services". 

13.  The DPA contains enforcement provisions at Part V which  are 

exercisable  by the Commissioner. Those provisions are modified  and 

extended for the  purposes of PECR by  Schedule  1 PECR. 

14.  Section 40(1)(a) of  the DPA  (as extended and modified  by  PECR) 

provides that if the Commissioner is satisfied that a person has 

contravened or  is contravening  any of the requirements of the 

Regulations,  he may  serve  him  with an  Enforcement Notice requiring 

him to take within such time  as may be specified in the  Notice,  or to 

refrain from  taking  after such time as may be so  specified,  such  steps 

as are so  specified. 

15.  PECR were enacted  to protect the individual's fundamental  right  to 

privacy  in the  electronic  communications sector.  PECR were 

subsequently  amended  and  strengthened.  The Commissioner will 

interpret  PECR  in a way  which  is consistent with the  Regulations' 

overall aim  of ensuring  high levels of protection for individuals' privacy 

rights. 

16.  The  provisions of  the  DPA remain  in  force for  the  purposes of PECR 

notwithstanding the introduction of the DPA18: see paragraph  58(1) of 

Schedule  20 to  the  DPA18.

The contravention 

17. 

The Commissioner finds that  Maxen  Power  contravened regulations 21 

and 24  of PECR. 

18.  The  Commissioner finds that the contravention was as follows: 

19.  Between  1 January  2020  and 31  December 2021,  Maxen  Power 

instigated the  use of a public electronic telecommunications service  for 

the purposes of making unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes 

to subscribers where the number allocated to  the subscriber in respect 

of the called line was a number listed  on the register  of numbers kept 

by the Commissioner  in accordance with regulation 26,  contrary to 

regulation  21(1)(b)  of PECR.  This resulted in a  large amount of 

complaints being made to the TPS and the  Commissioner. 

20.  The  Commissioner is also satisfied for the purposes of regulation  21 

that these  unsolicited  direct marketing calls were  either: 

(i) made to subscribers who had  registered with  the TPS or CTPS 

at least 28 days prior to  receiving the calls,  and  who for the 

purposes of regulation  21(4)  had not notified Maxen  Power that 

they did  not object to  receiving such calls;  or 

(ii)  made to  subscribers who  had  previously notified the company 

they did not wish to receive such calls. 

21. 

For notification to  be valid  under regulation 21(4), the subscriber must 

have taken a clear and positive action to override their TPS  registration 

and indicate their willingness to receive  marketing calls from the 

6 

company. 

The notification 

should reflect 

the subscriber's 

ICO. 

Information Commissioner's Office 
choice about 

whether or not they are willing 

to receive 

marketing 

calls. 

Therefore, 

where signing 

up to use a product 

or service 

is conditional 

upon 

receiving 

marketing 

calls, 

companies 

will  need  to 

demonstrate 

how this 

constitutes 

a clear and positive 

notification 

of the subscriber's 

willingness 

to receive 

such calls. 

22. The notification 

must clearly 

indicate 

the subscriber's 

willingness 

to 

receive 

marketing 

calls specifically. 

Companies 

cannot rely on 

subscribers 

opting in to marketing 

communications 

generally, 

unless it 

is clear that this will include 

telephone 

calls. 

23. Further, 

the notification 

must demonstrate 

the subscriber's 

willingness 

to receive 

marketing 

calls from that company specifically. 

Notifications 

will not be valid for the purposes 

of regulation  21( 4) 

if subscribers 

are 

asked to agree 

to receive 

marketing 

calls from "similar 

organisations", 

"partners", 

"selected 

third parties" 

or other similar 

generic 

descrlptions. 

24. Maxen Power advised 

the Commissioner 

that it used 'independent 

contractors' 

or 'third 

party intermediaries', 

meaning it was not 

responsible 

for the calls  being  made 

in the absence of a valid 

notification. 

However, 

it appears 

to the Commissioner 

that the business 

model of using overseas 

call centres 

was designed 

to avoid 

Maxen 

Power being identified 

as the instigator 

of the unsolicited 

calls. 

In any 

event, Maxen Power ought 

to have recognised 

the risks associated with 

using overseas 

call centres. 

25. Further, 

Maxen Power  failed  to 

provide 

the recipient 

of the calls with 

the particulars specified 
at regulation 

24(2) of PECR, and prevented 

the 

presentation 

of a line on which it could be contacted, 

in contravention 

7 

ICO. 

Information Commissioner's Office 

of regulation 21(Al}  of PECR. 

26.  The  Commissioner has considered,  as he  is required to do under 

section 40(2)  of the  DPA  (as extended and modified by  PECR)  when 

deciding  whether to serve  an  Enforcement Notice,  whether  any 

contravention  has  caused or  is  likely to cause any person  damage.  The 

Commissioner  has decided that it is likely that damage has been 

caused in this instance. 

27. 

In  view of  the  matters  referred  to  above,  the Commissioner 

hereby gives notice that,  in exercise of his  powers under 

section  40  of  the  DPA,  he  requires Maxen  Power  to take the 

steps specified in  Annex  1  of this  Notice. 

Right  of Appeal 

28.  There  is a right of appeal against this Notice  to  the  First-tier Tribunal 

(Information  Rights), part of the General Regulatory Chamber. 

Information  about appeals is set out  in the  attached Annex  2.
