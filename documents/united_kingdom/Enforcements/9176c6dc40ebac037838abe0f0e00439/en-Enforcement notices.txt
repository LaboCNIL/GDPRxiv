1   DATA PROTECTION ACT 1998  SUPERVISORY POWERS OF THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER  ENFORCEMENT NOTICE   To: Home2sense Limited   Of:    Ardeifi,  New Street,  Lampeter,  Ceredigion,  Wales,  SA48 7AL  1. The Information Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) has decided to issue Home2sense Limited (“Home2sense”) with an enforcement notice under section 40 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”). The notice is being issued because of a serious contravention of regulations 21 and 24 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (“PECR”).  2. This notice explains the Commissioner’s decision.           Legal framework  3. Home2sense, whose registered office is given above (Companies House Registration Number: 12219714) is the organisation stated in this notice to have used a public electronic communications service for the purpose of making unsolicited calls for the purposes of direct marketing contrary to regulation 21 of PECR.                                                                                                                                      2   4. Regulation 21 applies to the making of unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes. It means that if a company wants to make calls promoting a product or service to an individual who has a telephone number which is registered with the Telephone Preference Service Ltd (“TPS”), then that individual must have given their consent to that company to receiving such calls from it.  5. Regulation 21 paragraph (1) of PECR provides that:  “(1) A person shall neither use, nor instigate the use of, a public electronic communications service for the purposes of making unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes where-  (a) the called line is that of a subscriber who has previously notified the caller that such calls should not for the time being be made on that line; or  (b) the number allocated to a subscriber in respect of the called line is one listed in the register kept under regulation 26.”  6. Regulation 21 paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (5) provide that:         “(2)   A subscriber shall not permit his line to be used in contravention    of paragraph (1).  (3)   A person shall not be held to have contravened paragraph (1)(b) where the number allocated to the called line has been listed on the register for less than 28 days preceding that on which the call is made.                                                                                                                                      3  (4)  Where a subscriber who has caused a number allocated to a line of his to be listed in the register kept under regulation 26 has notified a caller that he does not, for the time being, object to such calls being made on that line by that caller, such calls may be made by that caller on that line, notwithstanding that the number allocated to that line is listed in the said register.          (5) Where a subscriber has given a caller notification pursuant to paragraph (4) in relation to a line of his—  (a) the subscriber shall be free to withdraw that notification at any time, and (b) where such notification is withdrawn, the caller shall not make such calls on that line.”  7. Regulation 24 of PECR provides:  “(1)  Where a public electronic communications service is used for the transmission of a communication for direct marketing purposes the person using, or instigating the use of, the service shall ensure that the following information is provided with that communication – …   (b) in relation to a communication to which regulation 21 [or 21A] (telephone calls) applies, the particulars mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) and, if the recipient of the call so requests, those mentioned in paragraph (2)(b).                                                                                                                                      4  (2) The particulars referred to in paragraph (1) are –  (a)  the name of the person; (b)  either the address of the person or a telephone number on which he can be reached free of charge.”  8. Under regulation 26 of PECR, the Commissioner is required to maintain a register of numbers allocated to subscribers who have notified them that they do not wish, for the time being, to receive unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes on those lines. The Telephone Preference Service Limited (“TPS”) is a limited company which operates the register on the Commissioner’s behalf. Businesses who wish to carry out direct marketing by telephone can subscribe to the TPS for a fee and receive from them monthly a list of numbers on that register.  9. Section 122(5) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA18”) defines direct marketing as “the communication (by whatever means) of advertising or marketing material which is directed to particular individuals”. This definition also applies for the purposes of PECR (see regulation 2(2) PECR and paragraphs 430 & 432(6) to Schedule 19 of the DPA18).  10. “Individual” is defined in regulation 2(1) of PECR as “a living individual and includes an unincorporated body of such individuals”.  11. A “subscriber” is defined in regulation 2(1) of PECR as “a person who is a party to a contract with a provider of public electronic communications services for the supply of such services”.  12. The DPA contains enforcement provisions at Part V which are exercisable by the Commissioner. Those provisions are modified and extended for the purposes of PECR by Schedule 1 PECR.                                                                                                                                     5   13. Section 40(1)(a) of the DPA (as extended and modified by PECR) provides that if the Commissioner is satisfied that a person has contravened or is contravening any of the requirements of the Regulations, he may serve him with an Enforcement Notice requiring him to take within such time as may be specified in the Notice, or to refrain from taking after such time as may be so specified, such steps as are so specified.   14. PECR were enacted to protect the individual’s fundamental right to privacy in the electronic communications sector. PECR were subsequently amended and strengthened. The Commissioner will interpret PECR in a way which is consistent with the Regulations’ overall aim of ensuring high levels of protection for individuals’ privacy rights.  15. The provisions of the DPA remain in force for the purposes of PECR notwithstanding the introduction of the DPA18: see paragraph 58(1) of Schedule 20 to the DPA18.          The contravention  16. The Commissioner finds that Home2sense contravened regulations 21 and 24 of PECR.   17. The Commissioner finds that the contravention was as follows:  18. Between 23 June 2020 and 31 March 2021, Home2sense used a public telecommunications service for the purposes of making 675,478 unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes to subscribers where the number allocated to the subscriber in respect of the called line was a                                                                                                                                     6  number listed on the register of numbers kept by the Commissioner in accordance with regulation 26, contrary to regulation 21(1)(b) of PECR. This resulted in 29 complaints being made to the TPS, with a further 33 being made to the Commissioner.   19. The Commissioner is also satisfied for the purposes of regulation 21 that these 675,478 unsolicited direct marketing calls were made to subscribers who had registered with the TPS at least 28 days prior to receiving the calls, and who for the purposes of regulation 21(4) had not notified Home2sense that they did not object to receiving such calls.   20. For such notification to be valid under regulation 21(4), the individual must have taken a clear and positive action to override their TPS registration and indicate their willingness to receive marketing calls from the company. The notification should reflect the individual’s choice about whether or not they are willing to receive marketing calls. Therefore, where signing up to use a product or service is conditional upon receiving marketing calls, companies will need to demonstrate how this constitutes a clear and positive notification of the individual’s willingness to receive such calls.   21. The notification must clearly indicate the individual’s willingness to receive marketing calls specifically. Companies cannot rely on individuals opting in to marketing communications generally, unless it is clear that this will include telephone calls.    22. Further, the notification must demonstrate the individual’s willingness to receive marketing calls from that company specifically. Notifications will not be valid for the purposes of regulation 21(4) if individuals are                                                                                                                                     7  asked to agree to receive marketing calls from “similar organisations”, “partners”, “selected third parties” or other similar generic descriptions.  23. Indeed, the extent to which Home2sense gave any attention to its legislative duties, not least in respect of regulation 21, is impossible to establish; Home2sense has failed to substantively engage with the Commissioner’s investigation, save for a brief and incomplete response on 7 July 2021 which itself followed a series of chaser correspondence from the Commissioner. At this time, Home2sense’s appointed Representative stated that in response to the Commissioner’s query for the source of the data used in its campaigns simply that “data was acquired from an unknown source”, having confirmed that no data is obtained from customers directly. The Commissioner would submit that it is simply inconceivable that Home2sense would be unable to confirm who its third-party data providers were, and the Commissioner can view this refusal to provide the information only as an attempt to obstruct his investigation. Home2sense’s dismissive and troubling response, coupled with its failure to disclose any details of its CDRs or any other information which might assist the Commissioner’s investigation shows, in the Commissioner’s view, a complete disregard for the privacy rights of the individuals whom it sought to contact. Going further, it seems reasonable to believe that Home2sense in fact gave no regard to its legislative duties regarding its direct marketing practices, given its suggestion on 7 July 2021 that PECR “would not be applicable” to its campaign.   24. The Commissioner is also concerned by Home2sense’s attempts to deflect responsibility for compliance with the law on to its staff, indicating that it was beyond its control to ensure staff screened data against the TPS register prior to making calls. Home2sense’s appointed Representative failed to provide any evidence that any such TPS checks                                                                                                                                     8  were actually carried out. It also failed to provide any training materials used for its staff so the Commissioner is unable to determine the efficacy of those, or even whether they actually exist. In any event, responsibility for compliance with the legislation rests on the organisation itself. The organisation should have implemented robust procedures to ensure that data which it purchased was either screened against the TPS before it was given to call agents, or that it had obtained valid notification under regulation 21(4).   25. Further, there is evidence from the complaints that Home2sense failed, as required by regulation 24 of PECR, to provide the recipient of the calls with the particulars specified at regulation 24(2) of PECR. In particular, when it did provide subscribers with the name of the caller, it used seemingly interchangeable trading styles which could not be readily identifiable as Home2sense.  26. The Commissioner has considered, as he is required to do under section 40(2) of the DPA (as extended and modified by PECR) when deciding whether to serve an Enforcement Notice, whether any contravention has caused or is likely to cause any person damage or distress. The Commissioner has decided that it is likely that damage or distress has been caused in this instance, as evidenced by the content of the complaints.  27. In view of the matters referred to above the Commissioner hereby gives notice that, in exercise of his powers under section 40 of the DPA, he requires Home2sense to take the steps specified in Annex 1 of this Notice.
