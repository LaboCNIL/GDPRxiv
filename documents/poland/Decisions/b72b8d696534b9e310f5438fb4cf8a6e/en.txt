S.A. a statement in which he called for a correct notification of the data subject about the breach of personal data protection and providing that person with recommendations to minimize the potential negative effects of the breach, which he did not include in the content of his notification addressed to the data subject.
At the above speech, Y. S.A. it has not replied within the time limit set.

In these facts, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office considered the following.
Pursuant to the provision of art. 105 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, when the proceedings for any reason have become redundant, the public administration authority issues a decision to discontinue the proceedings.
