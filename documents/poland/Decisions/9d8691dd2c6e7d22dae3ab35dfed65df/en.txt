Justification
In the proceedings with reference number [...], initiated on the basis of a complaint by AD (hereinafter also referred to as the "Complainant") regarding irregularities in the processing of her personal data, in a letter of [...] July 2020, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office asked the Company to respond to the content of the complaint and to provide explanations regarding. The letter was delivered on [...] July 2020. Despite the instruction that failure to respond to the summons may result in imposing a penalty, the Company did not reply to this letter
In the absence of a reply, in a letter of [...] September 2020, the President of UODO again asked the Company to comment on the content of the complaint and to provide explanations on the matter. The letter was delivered on [...] September 2020, pursuant to Art. 44 of the Act of June 14, 1960, Code of Administrative Procedure (i.e. Journal of Laws of 2020, item 256, as amended). - a consignment notified twice, not collected on time. The company did not reply to this letter either.
In connection with the above, the present administrative proceedings were initiated under the reference DKE.561.24.2020. [...] - concerning the imposition of an administrative fine on the Company for violation of Art. 31 and art. 58 sec. 1 lit. a) and e) of Regulation 2016/679, due to the failure to provide the information necessary for the President of the Personal Data Protection Office to perform his tasks. Information on the initiation of the administrative procedure in question and the collection of evidence in the case was delivered to the Company on [...] November 2020. The letter indicated that if the Company provided exhaustive explanations in the proceedings with reference number […], To be provided by the President of the Personal Data Protection Office and justify the previous failure to respond to these requests, this circumstance may result in the mitigation of the administrative fine imposed in this proceeding or may result in waiving its imposition.
On [...] December 2020, the Office for Personal Data Protection received a letter from the President of the Management Board of the Company, Mr. M. A .. The content of the letter contained answers to the questions of the President of the Personal Data Protection Office regarding reference number […]. The letter also indicated that the lack of an earlier response to the calls of the President of the Personal Data Protection Office "was caused by problems of an organizational nature, which resulted from the fact that due to the existing risk related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the Company's employees worked remotely."
After reviewing the entirety of the evidence collected in the case, the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection considered the following.
Pursuant to Art. 57 sec. 1 lit. a) Regulation 2016/679, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office - as a supervisory authority within the meaning of art. 51 of Regulation 2016/679 - monitors and enforces the application of this regulation on its territory. As part of his competences, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office examines, inter alia, Complaints brought by data subjects shall investigate these complaints to the appropriate extent and inform the complainant of the progress and the outcome of these proceedings within a reasonable time (Article 57 (1) (f)). In order to enable the performance of such defined tasks, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office has a number of specified in Art. 58 sec. 1 of Regulation 2016/679, the rights in the scope of conducted proceedings, including the right to order the administrator and the processor to provide all information needed to perform its tasks (Article 58 (1) (a)) and the right to obtain access from the administrator and the processor to all personal data and all information necessary for the performance of its tasks (Article 58 (1) (e)).
Moreover, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office is entitled to a number of provisions specified in Art. 58 sec. 2 corrective powers, including reminders to the administrator or processor in the event of violation of the provisions of Regulation 2016/679 by processing operations.
Violation of the provisions of Regulation 2016/679, consisting in the failure of the controller or the processor to provide access to the data and information referred to above, resulting in the violation of the authority's rights specified in art. 58 sec. 1 (including the right to obtain data and information necessary to perform its tasks), and is subject - in accordance with art. 83 section 5 letter e) in fine of Regulation 2016/679 - an administrative fine of up to EUR 20,000,000, and in the case of an enterprise - up to 4% of its total annual worldwide turnover from the previous financial year, with the higher amount applicable . It should also be indicated that the controller and the processor are obliged to cooperate with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks, as provided for in Art. 31 of Regulation 2016/679.
The President of the Personal Data Protection Office, acting pursuant to art. 58 sec. 2 lit. b) of Regulation 2016/679, it may also consider it justified to provide the Company with a reminder in the scope of the infringement of the provisions of Art. 31 and 58 sec. 1 lit. e) Regulation 2016/679.
Pursuant to recital 148 of Regulation 2016/679, for more effective enforcement of the provisions of the Regulation, sanctions, including administrative fines, should be imposed for breaches of the Regulation, in addition to or instead of appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority under this Regulation. If the infringement is minor, the fine may be replaced by an admonition. However, due attention should be paid to the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, whether the breach was not intentional, the steps taken to minimize the harm, the degree of liability or any previous relevant breach, how the supervisory authority became aware of on breach, on compliance with the measures imposed on the controller or processor, on the application of codes of conduct, and on any other aggravating or mitigating factors.
Referring the above-mentioned provisions of the Regulation 2016/679 to the facts established in this case, it should be stated that the Company as the administrator of personal data and at the same time a party to the proceedings with reference number [...], by failing to respond to the calls of the President of the Personal Data Protection Office of […] July and […] September 2020 to provide explanations, breached the obligation to provide the President of the Personal Data Protection Office with access to information necessary for the performance of his tasks, resulting from Art. 31 and art. 58 sec. 1. lit. e) Regulation 2016/679. In this case, the information essential for the further course of the proceedings was the confirmation of the validity of the complaint - including establishing the legal and factual relations between the Company and the Complainant.
There is no doubt that the organization of the circulation of correspondence is essentially within the competence of an economic entity and the consequences of negligence in this respect are borne by this entity. The necessity to work remotely due to the risk of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as the reason for not responding to the calls of the President of the Personal Data Protection Office is credible. However, this fact cannot be the basis for waiving the Company's liability for the omission in question.
The requests of the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (UODO) were finally answered in the explanations and attachments submitted by the Company in this case. Thus, they allowed the President of the Personal Data Protection Office to use the information received and to continue the proceedings in the case no. […]. This allows us to assume not so much a lack of will or willingness to cooperate with the President of the Personal Data Protection Office, but an ineffectively organized correspondence flow signaled by the Company, related to the need to work remotely due to the risk of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In the opinion of the President of UODO, no response to the calls of the President of UODO in the proceedings with reference number […] Was not intentional.
In connection with the above, acting pursuant to Art. 58 sec. 2 lit. b) of Regulation 2016/679, according to which each supervisory authority has the right to issue a reminder to the controller or processor in the event of a breach of the provisions of this Regulation by processing operations, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office considers it justified to grant Z. Sp. z o. o. admonition in the scope of the found violation of the provisions of Art. 31 and art. 58 sec. 1 lit. e) Regulation 2016/679.
The admissibility of replacing a financial penalty with a warning is also justified by recital 148 of Regulation 2016/679, which states that sanctions, including administrative fines, should be imposed "in order to make the enforcement of the provisions of this Regulation more effective". The President of the Personal Data Protection Office decided that in the case in question, in the light of the criteria set out in Art. 83 sec. 2 of Regulation 2016/679, it will be sufficient to issue a reminder.
However, it should be noted that in the event of a similar event occurring in the future, each reminder issued by the President of the Personal Data Protection Office against the Company will be taken into account when assessing the premises for a possible administrative penalty, in accordance with the principles set out in Art. 83 sec. 2 of the Regulation 2016/679.
In this factual and legal state, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office resolved, as in the operative part of this decision.
The decision is final. The party has the right to lodge a complaint against the decision with the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw, within 30 days from the date of its delivery, via the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection (address: ul. Stawki 2, 00-193 Warsaw). The complaint should be filed with a permanent fee in the amount of PLN 200, in accordance with Art. 231 in connection with Art. 233 of the Act of August 30, 2002, Law on proceedings before administrative courts (Journal of Laws of 2019, item 2325, as amended). A party (natural person, legal person, other organizational unit without legal personality) has the right to apply for the right to assistance, which includes exemption from court costs and the appointment of an attorney, legal advisor, tax advisor or patent attorney. The right to aid may be granted upon the application of a party submitted before the initiation of the proceedings or in the course of the proceedings. The application is free of court fees.
