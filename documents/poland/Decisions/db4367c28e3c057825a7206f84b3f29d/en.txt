Justification
The President of the Personal Data Protection Office (formerly the Inspector General for Personal Data Protection) received a complaint from Mr MJ, represented by Ms BD and Mr DO from the Law Firm [...] (hereinafter also referred to as: the "Complainant"), against the processing of his personal data by the Bank MSA, hereinafter referred to as "the Bank" and their transfer to BSA, hereinafter referred to as B.
In the content of the complaint, the complainant requested that the Bank be ordered to transfer his personal data concerning the contract of [...] February 2009 and the contract of [...] May 2008 [...] to the statistical section.
Moreover, in the content of the complaint, the Complainant indicated that the Bank, in connection with the receivables arising from the [...] agreement of [...] May 2008 and the credit card agreement of [...] February 2009, failed to meet the conditions under Art. 105a paragraph. 3 of the Banking Law of August 29, 1997 (Journal of Laws of 2019, item 2357, as amended), hereinafter referred to as the Banking Law, i.e. the Bank never notified the Complainant about the intention to process his personal data without his consent in the register of A.
In the course of the investigation conducted in this case, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office established the following facts:

The Bank [...] in May 2008 concluded with the Complainant an agreement [...] No. [...]. Pursuant to § 21 of the above-mentioned of the contract, the complainant gave his consent, inter alia, for the processing by the Bank and B. of information relating to his person, constituting banking secrecy, after the expiry of the obligation resulting from this agreement to the extent provided for by the provisions of the Banking Law Act.
The Bank […] in February 2009 concluded a credit card agreement no. […] With the Complainant. Pursuant to § 25 sec. 9 above of the contract, the Complainant expressed, inter alia, consent to the processing and disclosure by the Bank and B. of information relating to him, constituting banking secrecy, after the expiry of the obligation resulting from this agreement to the extent provided for in the provisions of the Banking Law Act.
The Bank provided the Complainant's data to B. on the urgent loan agreement in the report of [...] May 2008, and on the credit card agreement in the report of [...] February 2009.
The transfer of the Complainant's data was carried out pursuant to Art. 105 paragraph. 4 of the Banking Law and on the basis of the agreement of [...] September 2006 on the collection, processing and disclosure of information, concluded between the Bank and B.
The complainant on […] October 2012 repaid all debt due on his credit card transactions, while on […] October 2012, the debt due under the contract was paid in full […].
In connection with the repayment by the Complainant of the above-mentioned liabilities, the Bank and B. processed the complainant's personal data pursuant to art. 105a paragraph. 3 of the Banking Law, for the period specified in Art. 105a paragraph. 5 of the Banking Law, i.e. for a period of 5 years from the expiry of the obligation, i.e. in the case of the credit card agreement No. [...] until [...] October 2017, and in the case of the agreement [...] No. [...] to [ ...] October 2017
In addition, the Complainant's personal data related to the above-mentioned contracts have been moved to the so-called "Statistical database" and are processed for the purposes of applying internal methods and other methods and models referred to in Part Three of Regulation No. [...] (Article 105a (4) of the Banking Law) for the period specified in Art. 105a paragraph. 5 of the Banking Law, i.e. for a period of 12 years from the repayment of the liability.
As explained by the Bank, the conditions listed in Art. 105a paragraph. 3 of the Banking Law, were fulfilled towards the Complainant in the case of contract [...] no. [...] in the letter of [...] June 2009, and in the case of the credit card contract no. [...] in the letter [...] of June 2009. Taking into account the fact that the Complainant's representative to the complaint brought to the President of the Personal Data Protection Office also attached as evidence a copy of the letter of [...] January 2014, the mark: [...] containing, inter alia, notification of the processing of the Complainant's personal data without his consent for a period of 5 years from the repayment of the liability (evidence: a copy of the letter of [...] January 2014 in the case file), it was necessary to acknowledge that the Bank had effectively notified the Complainant about the intention to process his personal data without of his consent and thus fulfilled the obligation under Art. 105a paragraph. 3 of the Banking Law.

After analyzing the evidence collected in the case, the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection states as follows.
On May 25, 2018, the provisions of the Act of May 10, 2018 on the protection of personal data entered into force (Journal of Laws of 2019, item 1781), hereinafter also: "Act on the Protection of Personal Data of 2018 r. "
Pursuant to Art. 160 sec. 1-3 of the Act on the Protection of Personal Data of 2018, proceedings conducted by the Inspector General for Personal Data Protection, initiated and not completed before the date of entry into force of this Act, are conducted by the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection on the basis of the Personal Data Protection Act of 1997 in accordance with the principles set out in the Act of 14 June 1960 Code of Administrative Procedure (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 256, as amended). At the same time, the activities performed in the proceedings initiated and not completed before the date of entry into force of the provisions of the Act on the Protection of Personal Data of 2018 remain effective.
From May 25, 2018, also Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95 / 46 / EC (general regulation on the protection of personal data) (Journal of Laws UE L 119 of 04.05.2016, p. 1 and Journal of Laws UE L 127 of 23.05.2018, p. 2), hereinafter referred to as the "Regulation 2016/679 ".
Pursuant to Art. 57 sec. 1 of Regulation 2016/679, without prejudice to other tasks specified under this regulation, each supervisory authority on its territory monitors and enforces the application of this regulation (point a) and considers complaints submitted by the data subject or by - in accordance with Art. 80 by Regulation 2016/679 - the entity, organization or association, to the extent appropriate, conducts proceedings on these complaints and informs the complainant about the progress and results of these proceedings within a reasonable time (point f).
It should be noted here that the President of the Personal Data Protection Office, when issuing an administrative decision, is obliged to decide on the basis of the actual state of affairs at the time of issuing this decision. As the doctrine points out, “the public administration body assesses the facts of the case according to the moment of issuing the administrative decision. This rule also applies to the assessment of the legal status of the case, which means that a public administration authority issues an administrative decision based on the provisions of law in force at the time of its issuance (...). Settlement in administrative proceedings consists in applying the applicable law to the established factual state of an administrative case. In this way, the public administration body implements the goal of administrative proceedings, which is the implementation of the applicable legal norm in the field of administrative and legal relations, when such relations require it "(Commentary to the Act of June 14, 1960, Code of Administrative Procedure, M. Jaśkowska, A . Wróbel, Lex., El / 2012). Also the Supreme Administrative Court - in the judgment of May 7, 2008 in case no. Act I OSK 761/07 stated that: "when examining the legality of the processing of personal data, GIODO is obliged to determine whether the data of a specific entity are processed as at the date of issuing the decision on the matter and whether it is done in a legal manner".
Regulation 2016/679 constitutes provisions on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and provisions on the free movement of personal data, and protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to the protection of personal data (Article 1 (1) and (2) of Regulation 2016 / 679). This issue was adequately regulated by Art. 2 clause 1 of the Act on the Protection of Personal Data of 1997. In the light of the provisions of the above-mentioned legal act, the processing of personal data is authorized when any of the conditions listed in Art. 6 sec. 1 of Regulation 2016/679 (previously Article 23 (1) of the Personal Data Protection Act of 1997). These conditions apply to all forms of data processing listed in art. 4 point 2 of Regulation 2016/679 (formerly Article 7 point 2 of the Personal Data Protection Act of 1997), including, in particular, their disclosure. These conditions are also equal to each other, which means that for the legality of the data processing process, it is sufficient to meet one of them.
The legal act regulating in detail the processing of personal data of bank customers is primarily the Banking Law. Therefore, the assessment of the processing of the Complainant's personal data in connection with the contract between him and the Bank should be made in conjunction with the provisions of this Act.
Therefore, referring to the request of the Complainant's attorney regarding the legality of the currently conducted processing of his personal data, both by the Bank and by B., it should be noted that the Complainant's personal data was transferred by the Bank to B. with regard to information constituting banking secrecy in accordance with art. 105 paragraph. 4 of the Banking Law. Pursuant to this provision, banks may, together with banking chambers of commerce, establish institutions authorized to collect, process and make available to: banks - information constituting banking secrecy to the extent that this information is needed in connection with the performance of banking activities and in connection with the application of internal methods and other methods and models referred to in Part Three of Regulation No 575/2013; other institutions legally authorized to grant loans - information constituting banking secrecy to the extent to which such information is necessary in connection with granting loans, cash advances, bank guarantees and sureties; credit institutions - information constituting banking secrecy to the extent necessary to assess the consumer's creditworthiness, as referred to in art. 9 of the Act of 12 May 2011 on consumer credit; lending institutions and entities referred to in art. 59d of the Act of 12 May 2011 on consumer credit - on the basis of reciprocity, information constituting respectively banking secrecy and information provided by loan institutions and entities referred to in art. 59d of the Act of 12 May 2011 on consumer credit, to the extent necessary to assess the consumer's creditworthiness, as referred to in art. 9 of this Act, and credit risk analysis.
As shown by the factual findings, the Bank and B. are currently processing the Complainant's personal data in connection with the conclusion of the contract [...] of [...] May 2008 no. [...] and the credit card contract [...] February 2008, no. […], Only for the purposes of using internal methods and other methods and models referred to in Part Three of Regulation No 575/2013, to which they are entitled pursuant to Art. 105a paragraph. 5 of the Banking Law, i.e. for a period of 12 years from the repayment of the liability.
Moreover, according to the explanations of the Bank submitted in these proceedings and the evidence attached to the complaint lodged with the President of the Personal Data Protection Office by the Complainant's attorney (copy of the letter of [...] January 2014, ref. towards the Complainant, the obligation referred to in Art. 105a paragraph. 3 of the Banking Law, i.e. he effectively notified the Complainant about the intention to process his personal data without his consent (evidence in the case file).
Taking into account the above, it should be concluded that there was no reason for the President of the Personal Data Protection Office to issue a decision ordering the restoration of the lawful state, therefore it is not justified to issue any of the orders referred to in Art. 18 of the Personal Data Protection Act of 1997 and in Art. 58 of the Regulation 2016/679.
In this factual and legal state, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office resolved as in the sentence.
Based on Article. 127 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the decision, the party has the right to submit an application for reconsideration of the case within 14 days from the date of its delivery to the party. If a party does not want to exercise the right to submit an application for reconsideration of the case, he has the right to lodge a complaint against the decision with the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw within 30 days from the date of its delivery to the party. The complaint is lodged through the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (address: ul. Stawki 2, 00-193 Warsaw). The entry fee for the complaint is PLN 200. The party has the right to apply for the right to assistance, including exemption from court costs.
However, due to the state of epidemic in force on the date of the decision, pursuant to Art. 15zzr paragraph. 1 point 1 of the Act of March 2, 2020 on special solutions related to the prevention, prevention and combating of COVID-19, other infectious diseases and crisis situations caused by them (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 374), the running of this period currently it will not start; it will start to run on the day following the last day of the epidemic or immediately following any possible epidemic threat.
