The above facts of the case were determined by the President of the Personal Data Protection Office on the basis of official correspondence between the Company and the President of the Personal Data Protection Office, contained in the files of the proceedings with reference number [...]. This correspondence reflects all the attempts by the President of the Personal Data Protection Office to obtain access to information necessary for the performance of his tasks, i.e. in this case - to consider the case number [...].
Due to the failure by the Company to provide the information necessary to settle the case no. [...], the President of UODO, in a letter of [...] February 2022, initiated ex officio against the Company - pursuant to Art. 83 sec. 5 lit. e) Regulation 2016/679 - administrative proceedings to impose an administrative fine on the Company (reference number DKE.561.7.2022). The letter contained an instruction on the possibility of imposing on the Company - in the absence of a comprehensive response to this request - an administrative fine pursuant to Art. 83 sec. 5 lit. e) of Regulation 2016/679 in connection with the failure to provide access to personal data and information necessary for the President of the Personal Data Protection Office to perform his tasks (Article 58 (1) (a) and (b) of the GDPR) e) of Regulation 2016/679).

In response to the letter informing about the initiation of proceedings to impose an administrative fine on the Company, the Company, in a letter received by the Office on [...] March 2022, provided exhaustive explanations, which were requested by the President of UODO in letters from [...] July 2021 and [...] September 2021 The explanations of the Company allowed the President of the Personal Data Protection Office to conduct further proceedings in case no.

The company from [...] May 2021, although it did not change the address of its registered office - it changed the premises (room) - and moved to the upper floor in the building at the same address. The above change resulted in an unsuccessful attempt to deliver her correspondence by a postal worker who, out of "habit", tried to deliver it to the wrong room. During this period, there was a change of the postman, which was not properly implemented, because there are 8 companies in the building at the [...] address, but he did not know to which room the Company moved its activities. The company indicated that in the above-mentioned For reasons unknown to her, she also did not receive a notification. The company informed that due to the prevailing pandemic, it had implemented the obligation to work remotely, and the presence of a person authorized to receive correspondence was ensured at the company's headquarters. The failure to collect the correspondence by the Company was not deliberate and deliberate, and was the result of a fatal coincidence. The company assured that it would make every effort to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future and requested that the administrative fine be waived. At the same time, the Company applied for an extension of the deadline for the presentation of the financial statements requested by the President of the Personal Data Protection Office or another document presenting the amount of turnover and the financial result achieved by the Company in 2021. It indicated that, according to the information from the entity servicing the Company in the field of accounting, the report will be ready between [. ..] March 2022 and [...] April 2022, while the statutory deadline for its preparation is [...] June 2022.
After reviewing the entirety of the evidence collected in the case, the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection considered the following.


Legal justification
Pursuant to Art. 57 sec. 1 lit. a) of Regulation 2016/679, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office - as a supervisory authority within the meaning of art. 51 of the Regulation 2016/679 - monitors and enforces the application of this regulation on its territory. As part of his competences, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office examines, inter alia, Complaints brought by data subjects shall investigate these complaints to an appropriate extent and inform the complainant of the progress and the outcome of these proceedings within a reasonable time (Article 57 (1) (f)). In order to enable the performance of such defined tasks, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office has a number of specified in Art. 58 sec. 1 of Regulation 2016/679, the right to conduct proceedings, including the right to order the administrator and the processor to provide all information needed to perform its tasks (Article 58 (1) (a)) and the right to obtain access from the administrator and the processor to all personal data and all information necessary for the performance of its tasks (Article 58 (1) (e)).
Violation of the provisions of Regulation 2016/679 consisting in failure to provide access by the administrator or processor to the data and information referred to above, resulting in the violation of the authority's rights specified in art. 58 sec. 1 is subject to - in accordance with Art. 83 sec. 5lit. e) in fine of Regulation 2016/679 - an administrative fine of up to EUR 20,000,000, and in the case of an enterprise - up to 4% of its total annual worldwide turnover from the previous financial year, with the higher amount being applicable. In addition, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office is entitled to a number of provisions specified in Art. 58 sec. 2 remedial powers, including reminders to the administrator or processor in the event of violation of the provisions of Regulation 2016/679 by processing operations. The President of the Personal Data Protection Office, acting pursuant to art. 58 sec. 2 lit. b) of Regulation 2016/679 may be considered justified to provide the administrator or processor with a reminder in the event of a breach of the provisions of Regulation 2016/679, including the provisions of art. 58 sec. 1 lit. a) and e) of this legal act. Pursuant to recital 148 of Regulation 2016/679, for more effective enforcement of the Regulation, sanctions, including administrative fines, should be imposed for breaches of the Regulation, in addition to or in place of the appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority under this Regulation. If the infringement is minor, the fine may be replaced by an admonition. However, due attention should be paid to the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, whether the breach was not intentional, the steps taken to minimize the harm, the degree of liability or any prior breach, how the supervisory authority became aware of on a breach, on compliance with the measures imposed on the controller or processor, on the application of codes of conduct, and on any other aggravating or mitigating factors.
Referring to the above-mentioned provisions of Regulation 2016/679 to the facts established in the present case, and described at the beginning of this decision, it should be stated that the Company - the complainant's personal data administrator - as a party to the proceedings conducted by the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (UODO) no. [...] undoubtedly breached the obligation resulting from Art. 58 sec. 1. lit. a) and e) of Regulation 2016/679, i.e. the obligation to provide the President of the Personal Data Protection Office with access to personal data and information necessary for the performance of his tasks - in this case, to the substantive resolution of the case. It should be emphasized, however, that the Company was not aware of the administrative proceedings pending against it before the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (UODO), under reference number [...] on the breach of personal data protection, in which he is called to respond to the content of the complaint and provide information necessary to resolve the case. The information about the proceedings pending before the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (UODO) was only obtained from the letter of [...] February 2022, with which these proceedings were initiated. Then, as a result of obtaining information about pending proceedings against it, the Company submitted exhaustive explanations allowing the President of the Personal Data Protection Office to conduct further proceedings in the case no. [...]. In the opinion of the President of the Personal Data Protection Office, the lack of reaction of the Company to the requests for explanations was not deliberate, but caused by a change in the organization of work at the Company's seat and temporary difficulties in delivering correspondence to the Company by a new postal employee. The reasons for the initial lack of cooperation with the supervisory body indicated by the Company should be considered as credible and having a significant impact on the assessment of the Company's behavior in the context of choosing the sanction applied to it in these proceedings. In the opinion of the supervisory body, the Company's follow-up assets show that it is ready to continue to cooperate with it. At this point, it should also be pointed out that the very initiation of the proceedings to impose an administrative fine and the real perspective of imposing a financial penalty have become a clear signal for the Company that further evasion of the obligations imposed by the provisions of Regulation 2016/679 will inevitably lead to the application of the most severe sanctions provided for by these provisions.
Bearing in mind the above, acting pursuant to Art. 58 sec. 2 lit. b) of Regulation 2016/679, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office found it justified to provide the Company with a reminder regarding the infringement of the provisions and art. 58 sec. 1 lit. a) and e) of Regulation 2016/679, assuming that in the light of the criteria set out in Art. 83 sec. 2 of Regulation 2016/679, it will be effective and sufficient. It should be noted, however, that in the event of a similar event occurring in the future, each admonition issued by the President of the Personal Data Protection Office against the Company will be taken into account when assessing the premises for a possible administrative penalty, in accordance with the principles set out in Art. 83 sec. 2 of Regulation 2016/679.
In this factual and legal state, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office resolved as in the operative part of this decision
