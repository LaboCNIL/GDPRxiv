Summary 
The  Data  Protection  Authority  (DPA)  fulfils  many  tasks,  including  informing  citizens, 
businesses and public players on certain issues related to data protection. Among these 
issues, those related to the ‘secure’ disposal of data or data media are certainly recurrent. 

Regardless  of  their  motivations,  controllers  wish  to  carry  out  this  operation  but 
sometimes  lack  a  clear  vision  of  what  constitutes  a  satisfactory  result  (in  particular  in 
terms of the protection of personal data) and how to achieve such a result. 

The scarcity, at the international level, of reference documents on the subject, or even 
their absence at the European and national levels, combined with the desire of the DPA to 
provide  interested  parties  with  a  useful  guide  in  the  form  of  clear,  up-to-date  and 
comprehensive guidelines, are the basis of this recommendation. 

This  document  presents  the  various  existing  “sanitisation”  techniques  (overwriting, 
cryptographic erasure, degaussing, etc.) for different types of media (HD, SSD, paper, etc.) 
which either make access to the data impossible on a preserved medium (erasure without 
the option of recompilation and encryption), or result in the destruction of the medium 
(without the option of reconstruction). 

The recommendation also addresses this processing (sanitisation and destruction) more 
broadly by detailing its various aspects, both legal (in particular related to the GDPR) and 
technical or organisational and examines the processing from before the purchase of the 
medium to the verification and recording of results. 

Finally,  a  summary  table  shows  the  reader,  according  to  the  type  of  medium,  the 
recommended  sanitisation  and  destruction  techniques  to  achieve  the  desired  level  of 
confidentiality. 

While  the  principles  and  concepts  discussed  in  this  document  are  by  nature  relatively 
perennial, there are certain tools, methods or examples presented which, in view of the 
evolution  of  knowledge  and  technologies  in  the  field,  may  need  to  be  updated  more 
rapidly.  The  paragraphs  or  parts  of  the  text  potentially  concerned  are  preceded  by  '\\' 
(double backslashes).

1. Introduction  

01. As part of their activities, the controller1 encounters many situations in which they 
wish to ensure that the transfer of information media to another environment does 
not lead to an unauthorised disclosure of the data contained on these media. 

These  situations  in  which  the  controller  will  have  to  take  a  decision  on  the 
“sanitisation2”  of  data  are  often  linked  to  the  end  of  their  life  cycle  or  that  of  their 
medium, or to their reuse in a different security3 context. 

02. For example: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Scrapping of decommissioned IT equipment (in the broad sense4); 

 Sending of a photocopier for repair; 

 Disposal of paper archives; 

 Sorting of HR department files; 

 Transfer of computers to a charity; 

 Return of PCs in the context of a lease; 

 The end of the rental agreement for a multifunction printer; 

 Or the sale, after amortisation, of the company's desktops and laptops to staff 

members. 
 

03. The  controller  may  have  diverse  motives,  such  as  the  need  to  protect  data  of 
particular value to it or classified as ‘confidential’, the desire to stand out from the 
competition, the fear of a penalty5 and/or the desire to comply with the laws in force. 

 

1 Article 4.7 of the GDPR defines a “controller” as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or 
any other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing 
of personal data. 

2 The expression “data sanitisation” covers the notion of deep sanitisation (disinfection, cleaning) leaving 
no  trace  of  the  data.  The  US  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  defines  “media 
sanitisation” as a broad term for actions taken to render data written on media unrecoverable by ordinary 
and extraordinary means. 

3 Will this media be given or sold to a third party? Is it to be discarded or to be reused internally? If the 
medium is reused as is, the controller must ensure that the medium will be used in a security context at 
least equivalent to the context in which the medium was used previously (e.g.: information access policy 
comparable to that which prevailed in the initial environment of the medium, or even stricter). 

4 Such as PCs, servers, printers containing hard disks, removable media (USB key, DVD, external hard 
drive, etc.) or mobile devices (laptops, tablets, mobile phones, etc.). 

5 It should be noted that the GDPR provides for a violation of the provisions relating to the obligations of 
the controller/processor, including in particular Art.32 (security), administrative fines  of up to EUR 10

In  this  respect,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  controller  is  required,  under  penalty  of 
sanctions6, to comply with Article 5.1.e of the GDPR, which provides that “personal 
data must be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer 
than  is  necessary  for  the  purposes  for  which  the  data  are  processed”.  When  this 
period is exceeded, the controller must anonymise these data or permanently destroy 
them 7(see exceptions in the same article). 

04. Note that, if the protection of data leaving their initial environment is a growing 
concern for organisations of all types, it is partly because their protection within them 
is increasing. Thus, a stricter data access control policy reduces the probability that 
an unauthorised person can directly access these data. As a result, this person will be 
tempted to turn to other information access channels, requiring less effort such as 
data recovery on media that leave the organisation's controlled environment or are 
placed in a lower privacy/security level environment. 
 
05. With regard to the laws in force, we will retain more specifically, in the context of 
this  document,  the  European  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR8)  and  in 
particular its Article 32 (see Appendix B) on the security of processing and Articles 33 
and  34 (see Appendix B) relating to personal data breaches. Also note Article 5.1.f 
enshrining  the  obligation  to  protect  personal  data  against,  in  particular,  their 
unauthorised  processing  and  loss,  using  appropriate  technical  or  organisational 
measures. 
 
06. It should be noted that Article 4.12 of the GDPR defines personal data breach as 
“a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, 
unauthorised  disclosure  of,  or  access  to,  personal  data  transmitted,  stored  or 
otherwise processed”. 
 
07. The controllers and processors9, required to comply with their legal obligations 
must, therefore, have to take the appropriate technical and organisational measures 

 

million or, in the case of a company, up to 2% of the total annual worldwide turnover of the previous 
financial year, whichever is the higher (Art.83.4.a of the GDPR). 

The highest administrative fines to date (11/2020) imposed for security under the GDPR already amount 
to  millions  of  euros.  Thus,  the  British  data  protection  authority  (ICO),  in  agreement  with  the  other 
European data protection authorities (in application of the cooperation mechanism provided for in the 
GDPR, known as the one-stop shop) has imposed fines of nearly 21 million euros on the Marriott hotel 
group and nearly 22 million euros on British Airways for security breaches (violation of Art.5.1.f and 32 - 
see Appendix B). 

6 Refer, for example, to the penalty of EUR 160,000 imposed by the Danish authority on a taxi company 
that kept the telephone details of a reservation for more than two years and the penalty (EUR 200,000) 
imposed by the same authority on a furniture store for failing to erase customer data when renewing 
computer equipment. 

7 A temporary organisation needs to collect the data of a certain number of members to be able to file a 
petition, who must be authenticated as actual persons. After authentication, this organisation, which has 
no other purpose, must not keep any personal data and must therefore delete all of them as well as the 
petitions containing them since only the number of validated signatories is important (deletion following 
the achievement of the purpose). 

8  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  27  April  2016  on  the 
protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement 
of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/CE. The GDPR has been in effect since 25 May 2018. 

9 Article 4.8 of the GDPR defines a “processor” as a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or 
other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

in  order  to  guarantee  the  confidentiality  of  the  personal  data10  present  on  the 
information media that they wish to sanitise. 
 
08. The Data Protection Authority (DPA), responsible for ensuring compliance with 
the  fundamental  principles  of  personal  data  protection,  of  which  the  principles  of 
security and confidentiality11 are essential elements, aims through this document to 
assist controllers and processors in complying with these principles. 
 
09. To do this, this document presents various “sanitisation” techniques which either 
make access to data impossible on a preserved medium (erasure without the option 
of recompilation and encryption), or lead to the destruction of the medium (without 
the option of reconstruction). 
 
10. The controller will choose from this range of techniques, taking into account in 
particular  the  type  of  medium, 
level  of 
confidentiality of the data. 

its  subsequent  allocation  and  the 

Limitations 

11. Only techniques leading to “sanitisation” of the entire medium or to its destruction 
are discussed in this document. The specific erasure of files, directories or partitions 
is therefore not processed. 
 
12. The following is not covered in this document: 

 Cases where access to media/data for erasure or destruction is not possible, 
such  as  cloud  storage  or  hardware  from  a  PCaaS12  contract.  It  is  up  to  the 
controller, before choosing their cloud provider or other remote storage provider, 
to examine what service they offer to delete data securely; 
 

 The erasure of data contained in the vehicles (navigation data, data from the 
synchronisation  of  contacts  with  the  mobile  phone,  etc.)  during  a  repair  at  the 
garage or at the end of a leasing contract, for example; 
 

 The  erasure  of  data  on  mobile  devices  via  specific  software  or  centralised 
management (e.g.: Active Directory). Apple is putting online a procedure for the 

 

10  Article  4.1  of  the  GDPR  defines  “personal  data”  as  any  information  relating  to  an  identified  or 
identifiable natural person (hereinafter ‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be 
identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification 
number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, 
genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. 

11 The controller and the processor must ensure the security and confidentiality of the information that 
they  process.  In  particular,  they  must  ensure  that  only  authorised  persons  have  access  to  this 
information. 

12 “Personal Computer as a Service”, also known as “Device as a Service”: a device lifecycle management 
model  in  which  an  organisation  pays  a  monthly  subscription  to  a  vendor,  to  lease  equipment  and 
associated management services.

erasure  of  personal  data  for  the  iPhone  and  iPad13,  and  Google  for  Android 
devices14; 
 

 Restoring factory settings. The controller will, however, ensure that the non-

volatile memory no longer contains personal data15; 
 

 The use of images, created by an operating system imaging and deployment

Target audience 

13. This document is intended for controllers and processors17 (whether in the public 
or  private  sector),  their  information  security  advisers  and  data  protection  officers 
(DPOs) or any other person or organisation that needs or wishes to make access to 
personal data impossible. 
 

Objectives 

14. This document aims to: 

 Help the target audience to formalise and integrate the different steps to make 

an informed choice of an appropriate “sanitisation” technique; 
 

 Provide information on the different methods and techniques available, their 
levels of confidentiality and the results that can be expected depending on the 
type of medium concerned. 
 

 Help the target audience to comply with certain GDPR requirements, including 
those relating to accountability (principle of accountability defined in Article 5.2 
of the GDPR) and those intended to prevent unauthorised disclosure of data.

15 This function returns the device to the condition it was in when it left the factory (generally equivalent 
to the condition it was in when the device was purchased). It mainly concerns the non-volatile memory 
(does not erase in the absence of power) integrated on the cards and peripherals. For example, remote 
management  integrated  into  a  motherboard  can  contain  IP  addresses,  user  names,  passwords  or 
certificates. Therefore, for erasure it may be necessary to interact with multiple interfaces to completely 
reset the device status. This can include the BIOS/UEFI38 interface as well as the remote management 
interface. 

16 Image  deployment  software  captures  an  image  of  the  operating  system  installed  on  a  device  and 
deploys it to similar devices (PCs, servers, mobiles, etc.). 

17 Pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR, both the controller and the processor implement the appropriate 
technical and organisational measures to ensure the constant confidentiality of the processing systems 
and services. This document may be of interest to a processor wishing to offer its services to a controller.

2. Preliminary principles and concepts 
15. The ‘sanitisation’ or destruction of a data18 medium will be: 

 Authorised (according to an internal procedure and/or applicable law); 

 

 Appropriate (irreversible, in accordance with the risk analysis and the resulting 

 Supervised by the controller (in the event of subcontracting, see section 3.1.3. 

security/confidentiality requirements); 
 

for additional measures to be taken); 
 

 Documented (proof of destruction, see 6th part); 

 And executed at the right time (consider legal deadlines, problems related to 

 

standby storage). 
 

2.1. Information classification and inventory 
16. In order to be able to determine which method should be used to best mitigate the 
risks  of  unauthorised  disclosure  of  data,  the  controller  must  know  a  number  of 
elements. 

2.1.1. The type and categories of data on the medium 
17. At  the  very  least,  the  controller  must  know  whether  or  not  personal  data  are 
present and if so, it may also usefully want to: 

 Identify,  in  these  data,  which  data  is  “sensitive”  (belonging  to  a  particular 
category19) or relates to criminal convictions or offences (Article 10 of the GDPR); 
 

 Distinguish between data that are encrypted20 , and/or pseudonymised21; 

 

 Classify the data according to the risk that the unauthorised disclosure of all or 
part of the personal data contained on the medium would represent for the data 
subject. It is preferable when estimating the risk, to consider an overall disclosure 
of all the data contained on a medium or in a device, which often corresponds to 

 

18 Note that we use the terms "information" or "data" indiscriminately, not knowing whether the medium 
contains the former or the latter or both. Data refers to raw data, used to obtain information after analysis. 
The  information  is  interpreted  and  gives  meaning  to  the  data.  Thus  the  data  '21122021'  becomes 
information if we know that it is a date (21 December 2021). 
19 Article 9.1 of the GDPR lists these special categories of personal data. These are data revealing racial 
or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic 
data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or 
data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation. 

20 Encrypted data is data that has been made unintelligible to people without the correct decryption key. 

21 Article 4.5 of the GDPR defines pseudonymisation as the processing of personal data in such a manner 
that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional 
information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and 
organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable 
natural person.

the reality  on the ground.  For example, when a database server is hacked, it is 
usually all the databases that are accessed simultaneously. 
 

18. In  fact,  the  procedure  put  in  place  by  the  controller,  in  order  to  determine 
the appropriate “sanitisation” method,  may  be  based  in  whole  or  in  part  on  the 
information provided in par. 17. 
 
19. We  would  like  to  reiterate  here  that  anonymised  data22  no  longer  meet  the 
definition of personal data insofar as they can no longer be linked to an identified or 
identifiable natural person. 
 
20. The  nature  and  categories  of  data  must  be  associated,  according  to  a  policy 
validated by the controller, with a technique making it possible to achieve the required 
level of confidentiality (clear, purge or destroy – see section 3.1.2.). 
 
21. It is therefore necessary to have an inventory and a classification of information23.  

2.1.2. The nature and characteristics of the medium 
22. There are many types (hard disks, SSDs, magnetic tapes, floppy disks, iPhones, SD 
cards, microfilms, etc.) and classes (optical, electronic, magnetic, write once, paper, 
etc.) of media. 
 
23. It is logical that the highly different technical and physical characteristics of these 
information  media  have  an  effect  on  the  choice  of  the  method  of  ‘sanitisation’. 
Moreover, not all techniques are available for all types and classes of media. Consider, 
for example, degaussing for a paper medium or overwriting for a write once medium. 
 
24. The classification of the data and the nature of the medium are the main criteria 
used  to  determine  the  processing  of the media  and the  method  that  will  be  used. 
To make this choice, the classification will serve as the first filter, insofar as it provides 
information on the level of sensitivity/confidentiality of the data and on the risk for 
data subjects in the event of unauthorised disclosure. Considerations based on the 
type and class of the medium will be used in a second step. 
 
25. Other additional factors can be taken into account such as cost, environmental 
impact, subsequent allocation 3 or duration of the process. 
 
 
 

 

22 Extract from recital 26 of the GDPR : […] The principles of data protection should therefore not apply 
to  anonymous  information,  namely  information  which  does  not  relate  to  an  identified  or  identifiable 
natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or 
no longer identifiable. […] 
23 Inventory of assets and classification of information is an integral part of an information management 
system. Thus, measure 8.2.1 (Asset management) of ISO 27002 classifies information in terms of value, 
sensitivity to disclosure or modification, legal requirements or their critical nature. NB: measure 6.5.2.1 of 
ISO 27701 (additional implementation guidance for 8.2.1 of ISO 27002), although dedicated to personal 
data, does not provide much information on a specific classification.

2.2. Processing steps 
26. Concisely, the main steps of the ‘sanitisation’ and destruction operations could be 
as follows: 

A. Policy (security and confidentiality) 

responsibility  of 

the  stakeholders  extends  beyond 

27. The  first  step  is  to  draw  up,  in  a  document,  a  policy  line  validated  by  the 
management  and  covering  the  entire  data  sanitization  issue  and  including  all  the 
existing data media in the organisation. This document must in particular describe the 
context,  the  goals  to  be  achieved,  the  ‘sanitisation’  or  destruction  authorisation 
procedure (including for back-ups) and the various stages of processing. It will also 
describe in detail the responsibilities of stakeholders (and the management) for the 
execution  as  well  as  the  control  of  the  different  stages  of  processing  (chain  of 
responsibility). It is important that each step, without exception, be placed under the 
responsibility of a duly appointed person (see example in par.240). 
 
28. The 
the  actual 
sanitisation/destruction  procedure.  It  may  be  useful  to  determine  who  would  be 
responsible for damage to reputation, and possible penalties if, at a later stage, it turns 
out  that  certain  data  media  have  not  been  processed  according  to  the  validated 
procedure. 
 
29. The  authors  of  the  document  will  ensure  complete  top-down  support  of  the 
hierarchy.  In  binding  areas,  such  as  security  and  confidentiality,  the  support  of 
management  is  indispensable,  otherwise  these  policies  will  remain  on  paper,  the 
content  of  which  is  not  enforced.  Care  should  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the 
responsibility for ‘sanitisation’ of media is assigned to a member of the organisation 
with an appropriate level of authority. 
 
30.  The implementer(s) will also ensure that the policy is known to all stakeholders 
who  have  a  role24  in  it,  that  it  is  properly  executed  in  practice  and  updated  if 
necessary25. It is important that this execution of the instructions and their results are 
also checked. 
 
31. A  report26 from  Blancco  shows  that  the  discrepancies  between  the  creation, 
communication and execution of the media sanitisation policy put sensitive data at 
risk. The study identifies the following risks: 

 Not taking direct responsibility for the erasure of IT assets;

sanitization-policies:  Although  96%  of  the  heads  of  organisations  consulted  have  a  data  disinfection 
policy, 31% have yet to communicate it to the whole company. 20% of respondents also do not think their 
organisation's  policies  are  complete.  Overall,  56%  do  not  have  a  data  cleaning  policy  in  place  that  is 
regularly communicated effectively across the organisation, which increases the risk of potential data 
breaches. 

25  Like  all  other  policies,  this  must  be  part  of  a  cycle  that  includes  an  update  stage.  There  are  many 
reasons why an update would be necessary. Consider a change in the context of security/confidentiality 
within  the  organisation  or  a technological  upgrade  (for  example,  coercive  force  of  a  degausser  to  be 
adapted according to the evolution of the media, see par. 120).

B. Inventory 

32. Take  a  full  inventory  of  all  the  equipment  you  have  marked  as  needing 
‘sanitisation’ or destruction. Determine the type(s) of media involved. If this has not 
already been done, take an inventory of the data contained on the information media 
to be processed in order to sort them according to a relevant classification, namely; 

 depending on the type of personal data found therein, 

 and  whether  their  disclosure  would  represent  a  high  risk  for  the  rights  and 
freedoms of the data subjects (as is a priori the case for data of special categories 
listed in Article 9 of the GDPR). 
 

33. If the controller does not know the content of the information medium (damaged 
medium  or  obsolete  technology,  lack  of  time  or  personnel,  etc.),  it  will  treat  this 
medium as if it contained personal data, the disclosure of which would represent a 
high risk for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. 
 
34. We would also reiterate that the GDPR requires controllers to keep a record of 
processing activities (for personal data) which includes in particular a description of 
the categories of personal data processed (Article 30.1.c). 
 
35. If the controller wishes to make this document a compliance tool that is broader 
than  a  simple  record,  it  can  usefully  include  information  such  as  the  nature  of  the 
medium  used  for  the  processing,  the  destruction  or  sanitisation  technique  and  its 
trigger (replacement or obsolescence of the hardware, exit of a co-worker, purpose 
fulfilled, legal deadlines reached, etc.). 
 

C. Risk analysis 

36. This  mainly  involves  determining  the  risk  incurred  if  an  unauthorised  person 
accesses  personal  data  contained  in  the  information  medium,  which  constitutes  a 
data breach and an infringement of Articles 5.1.f and 32.2. of the GDPR (see Appendix 
B).  Also  take  into  consideration  any  possible  security  loopholes  associated  with 
each technique27. 

 

27 Search the Internet for vulnerabilities associated with the selected technique or tool. For example, you 
can refer to the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) list, which includes the largest number of 
publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Other sources of interest:  Exploit Database, U.S. National 
Vulnerability Database (NVD) of the NIST, packet storm.

37. It is important to note that the concern of the GDPR (and the DPA) is about the 
impact of the disclosure 

 of “personal” data (and not of all the data of the organisation), 

 

 

 of data concerning the data subject (i.e. the person to whom the data relates) 

and not concerning the organisation. 
 

38. While the risk analysis is an essential step, the controller, assisted by its possible 
Data  Protection  Officer,  could  also  usefully  carry  out  a  “data  protection  impact 
assessment” (DPIA, Article 35 of the GDPR28), whether or not it is mandatory.  

 The DPIA will help the controller to ask the right questions; 

 It will contain information useful for filling in the processing record (Article 30 

of the GDPR); 
 

 It will help to fulfil the obligation of data protection by design (Article 25 of the 
GDPR). Since the DPIA serves, also before processing, to identify the measures 
to be taken to deal with the risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, 
it can provide valuable assistance in this regard. 
 

39. If the DPIA were to indicate that the processing still presented a high risk, after 
the controller has taken measures to mitigate the identified risks, the controller must 
consult  the  Data  Protection  Authority  prior  to  the  implementation  of  processing 
(Article 36 of the GDPR). 

 

D. Security measures 

40. The  next  step  is  to  put  in  place  the  technical  and  organisational  measures  to 
reduce any identified risks to an acceptable level (for the organisation and for the data 
subjects). 
 
41. This  step  also  includes  identifying  actions  that  could  be  taken,  quickly  and 
efficiently,  to  respond  to  a  possible  data  breach.  If  personal  data  were  to  be 
compromised during media ‘sanitisation’ or even after you leave your  organisation, 
you could still be held liable for the breach (you remain the controller until the end of 
the data lifecycle). 
 

E. Assessment 

42. It  is  then  necessary  to  assess  to  what  extent  the  actions  undertaken  have 
achieved the set objective (preventing loss of confidentiality). If necessary, choose 
another technique.

F. Documentation 

43. The different stages must be documented in detail. The principle of accountability 
of  the  GDPR  (defined  in  Article  5.2)  in  fact  implies  that  the  controller  is  able  to 
demonstrate its compliance with the data protection rules. In particular, the following 
will be documented: the justification29 of the method chosen, the description of the 
measures  taken  (steps  of  the  method,  verification  included)  and  the  proof  of  their 
proper execution (for example, by issuing a document containing all the information 
related to ‘sanitisation’ or destruction of the medium and, after a verification step, the 
result, failure or success). 
 
44. In  order  to  strengthen 
its  transparency  vis-à-vis  the  data  subjects,  we 
recommend that the controller communicate certain information, in addition to the 
information that must be communicated under Articles 13, 14 and 15 of the GDPR. 
Thus, in addition to the data retention period (Articles 13.2.a, 14.2.a and 15.1.d), it may, 
without  effort,  using  the  documentation  already  at  its  disposal,  inform  them  more 
concretely of what will happen to their data once this period has elapsed. 
 
45. Likewise,  we  will  recommend  that  the  controller  adopt  the  same  transparent 
attitude, in the context of their communication with the data subject relating to Article 
17 of the GDPR (right to erasure). 

 
G. Example 

46. Here is a more concrete example illustrating the main steps of a data cleansing 
and/or media destruction project: 

1. You plan  to  replace some computers in your organisation  and  sell them to a 
company that will refurbish them before reselling them. 

2. You  determined  during  the  inventory  phase  that  the  media  contained  in  the 
PCs were ATA hard disks with a capacity of 500GB and contained HR personnel 
files and that these files included special categories of personal data (sensitive 
data such as trade union membership or data related to absences due to illness). 

3. According  to  your  security/confidentiality  policy,  personal  data  must  remain 
under  your  control  at  all  times,  so  no  data  can  leave  the physical  and/or 
logical perimeter of your company. 

4. In the risk analysis, you compare the different methods meeting this objective 
(erasure, storage, destruction). 

5. In view of the nature of the data, the time needed to erase the hard disks, the 
possibility that some data may remain accessible, the low resale value of the PCs, 
the risk to the organisation (e.g. reputation, financial, legal proceedings, etc.) and 

 

29 The justification may be based on a balancing of the interests of the controller with the rights and 
interests of the data subject and/or an assessment of the risk inherent in the processing, considering the 
state of knowledge and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal 
data to be protected.

the  risk  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  data  subjects  (e.g.  identity  theft, 
scamming, phishing, blackmail, discrimination, etc.), you consider that the risk is 
not worth taking. 

6. Consequently, in order to reduce the risk to an acceptable level, you opt for the 
physical destruction of the media and take the following measures: 

A. Whether the destruction is done within the organisation or by an external 
partner,  you  appoint  the  managers involved  in  the  project:  the  operational 
manager will be a member of the IT department while the overall supervision 
will be provided by the DPO who will give a positive (or negative) opinion at the 
end of the procedure, knowing that a final decision, whether it concerns the 
choice of the sanitisation method, the level of confidentiality achieved, or the 
agreement to release/transfer the media always rests with the controller (the 
management of your organisation). This or these decisions could usefully be 
referenced in the record of processing activities; 

B. You decide that the destruction must be carried out within the confines of 
the organisation, in the presence of the project manager; 

C. You choose30 a specialised external partner, offering guarantees of quality 
and respect for confidentiality, who can, using mobile equipment, implement 
the technique you have selected. You check with the service provider that the 
technical  characteristics  of  the  equipment  used  (e.g.  maximum  size  of 
destruction residues) meet the requirements of your security/confidentiality 
policy. 

7. You  ensure  that  the  destruction  took  place  according  to  the  established 
procedure  and  that  the  data  are  no  longer  usable.  You  collect  and  keep  the 
evidence of the actual destruction of the media (for the whole or specific to each 
medium) as well as all the information useful for demonstrating your compliance 
with legal obligations. 

2.3. In the best of all worlds 
47.  In a perfect world, you will have already thought about the ‘secure sanitisation’ of 
your media, even before their acquisition and asked the vendor of these media on this 
subject.  For  organisations  having  to  draw  up  specifications, 
include 
specifications  relating  to  the  erasure  commands  integrated  into  the  equipment  (if 
applicable - see Articles 3.2.1.2. And 3.2.4.1.) and require the assistance of the vendor 
and the provision of certain related information (e.g.: execution time, description of 
supported commands and their options or excluded areas). This should facilitate the 
informed choice of a storage medium or of a device comprising a storage medium, on 
the basis of the secure erasure options offered by the product. 
 

it  may 

 

30  Let  us  reiterate  here  that  the  controller  has  a  responsibility  and  obligations  in  the  choice  of  the 
processor (Article 28 of the GDPR). The reputation of the vendor is not sufficient assurance. The written 
contract, binding between the controller and the processor, will help ensure that an appropriate level of 
security is in place and will mention as precisely as possible the method chosen, its characteristics and 
the means to be implemented.

17 

 

48.  Likewise, collecting all the technical information needed at the time of acquisition 
will not only facilitate the ‘inventory’ stage of the processing but also the ‘risk analysis’ 
stage  where  you  will  have  to  compare  the  different  erasure  techniques  available 
depending on the characteristics of the medium. 
 
49.  For example, knowing the coercivity31 of a magnetic medium, we can include or 
exclude  degaussing  (see  section  3.2.3.)  from  the  list  of  available  techniques. 
Alternatively,  having  noted  that  two  different  types  of  disks  (hard/magnetic  and 
SSD/electronic) are present in the organisation's computers, the operational manager 
will know that they must be distinguished when choosing the ‘cleaning’ method. \\ It 
should be noted that both types of disks can be present simultaneously in the devices 
(SSD  disks  are  much  faster  but  more  expensive,  and  are  often  used  to  boot  the 
computer  and  coupled  with  a  slower  magnetic  hard  disk,  but  which  takes  care  of 
storing most of the data). 

3. The different methods and techniques 

3.1. Introduction 
3.1.1. Important details 
50. From the outset, let us make an important point, by specifying that simply deleting 
(by pressing the delete key on your keyboard, for example) files or directories via the 
interface of your device erases only pointers to these files and not the data itself. By 
erasing the pointers, the device makes the area where the files were located available 
again for writing other data. As an analogy, it is like for deleting the chapter of a book, 
you delete any reference to the said chapter in the table of contents. By going through 
the book, you can therefore find the content of the chapter. 
 
51. This  is  why  this  action,  which  does  not  result  in  any  actual  erasure,  is  not 
commented on in this document.  
 
52. Note also that formatting does not erase data either, whether it is quick or full32. 

3.1.2. Three levels of confidentiality 
53. In  the  specialised  literature,  the  different  techniques  are  often  classified 
according  to  the  level  of  confidentiality  (security)  desired  or,  in  other  words,  the 
probability  of  recovery  of  the  initial  data.  There  are  three  levels  of  confidentiality 
associated with three classes of techniques: clear, purge and destroy. 

 Clear level techniques aim to prevent data recovery carried out using software. 
They offer moderate confidentiality (some data can be recovered if the necessary 
time,  knowledge  and  competence  are  available).  These  are  purely 
logical33 techniques. 

 

31 In this context, coercivity refers, in non-academic terms, to the force that is required for a magnetic 
field to modify data stored on a magnetic medium. The higher it is, the more difficult it will be to modify 
(‘erase’) the data using a degaussing technique. 
32 The difference between the two is mainly due to the fact that a full format will check all the bad sectors, 
which explains the long duration of the operation compared to a quick format. 
33 The term ‘logical’ refers to a technique in which the mechanisms are implemented using software. 

Information media erasure and destruction guide | Version 1.01 - 23/03/2021

18 

 

 
Examples:  (partial)  overwriting  using  standard  commands  (read  and  write)  and 
resetting the  device  or  media  (‘factory’  reset  -  often  recommended for  mobile 
devices and routers/switches). 
 

 Purge level techniques are designed to prevent data recovery performed using 
advanced laboratory techniques. They offer a higher level of confidentiality and 
are  appropriate  when  the  medium 
in  a 
security/confidentiality  context  different  from  the  initial  context.  These  are 
logical and physical techniques. 
 
Examples:  overwriting  using  dedicated  commands,  degaussing  and 
cryptographic erasure (see section 3.2.4.).  
 
 

intended  to  be  reused 

is 

 Destroy techniques offer  the  highest  level  of  confidentiality/security.  Data 
recovery is indeed impossible, even using advanced laboratory techniques. They 
are based on physical destruction and are therefore incompatible with reuse of 
the medium. Note that a technique rendering the medium unusable will not reach 
the destroy level if some data nevertheless remains recoverable. 
 
Examples : incineration, shredding and crushing. 
 

54. The  different  techniques  presented  in  this  document  all  fall  into  one  of  these 
three classes. The reader will find in Appendix A, a table showing the most common 
types of information media34, associated with the different techniques which can be 
applied to them according to the level of confidentiality/security required (clear, purge 
and destroy). 
 
55. The level of confidentiality to be achieved, followed by the choice of a technique 
allowing  this  level  to  be  reached,  depending on  the  type  of  medium,  is  based  on  a 
preliminary risk analysis.

lead to physical destruction of the information medium.

Sanitization” of the “NIST Special Publication 800-88”.

3.1.3. Processing not supervised by the controller 
57. When the destruction or ‘sanitisation’ of the medium is subcontracted or partially 
subcontracted and is therefore not carried out under the end-to-end control of the 
controller, the latter must obtain assurances as to the proper conduct of the various 
stages of processing. To achieve this, we will recommend the following measures: 

 The  use  of  eye  witnesses  (validated  by  the  service  provider  and/or  the 

controller); 
 

processing; 
 

storage; 
 

 

 

 The  transport  of  the  media  in  secure  and  locked  vehicles.  Although  the 
protection provided by  the security seals is not absolute35 (it could possibly  be 
overcome by trained and equipped attackers), vehicles may be usefully provided 
with them; 
 

 Taking photographs or using other documentation techniques at each stage of 

 The  establishment  of  a  continuous,  non-stop  process  involving  temporary 

 Procedures for monitoring and selecting personnel involved in the processing; 

 The issuance of a certificate of destruction by the processor (see 6th part). 

58. It is advisable to include these measures in the contract between the controller 
and  the  processor  and  to  describe  therein,  where  applicable,  the  elements 
constituting  the  proof  of  destruction  (in particular  the  method  used  and  the  result 
obtained). In this regard, the reader may refer to the clauses in a document36 of the 
government services of New Brunswick (Canada). 
 

3.2. The data medium is retained 
59. As a preamble to the various techniques presented in this chapter, it is important 
to note that apart from a destruction method that leaves no part of the medium intact 
(regardless of the nature of the medium – paper, magnetic or other), it is difficult to 
guarantee  that  no  more  data  will  be  usable  on  the  entire  surface  of  the  medium, 
including by specialised laboratories. 
 
60. If the risk of data remaining on the medium or that it can be reconstructed is not 
acceptable to the controller (taking into account the risk to data subjects), a method 
resulting in the destruction of the medium will be preferred (see chapter 3.3.). 

3.2.1. Erasure - overwriting 
61. The “erasure” (also called overwriting or rewriting) consists of writing, in the same 
place as that where the data already present on an information medium are found, one

or more series of information elements – determined, random or both (depending on 
the protocol chosen) – in order to reduce the possibility of being able to recover the 
data thus overwritten (or rewritten). 
 
62. It would therefore be more appropriate to speak of an “overwrite” method than of 
an erasure37  method because the initial information or parts of this information are 
still  potentially  present  on  the  medium,  depending  on  the  efficiency  of  this 
overwriting. 
 
63. Overwriting is obviously not applicable to media which are natively ‘write once’ or 
which no  longer  support  writing  following  damage  (breakdown,  partial  destruction, 
wear). 
 
64. This method can lead to two levels of confidentiality, namely ‘clear’ and ‘purge’. 
The level achieved will depend on the combination of the type of medium containing 
the  data,  the  software  used  (linked  to  the  hardware  or  independent)  and  the 
associated commands (standard or dedicated). The choice and the correct use of the 
software  and  the  commands  will  themselves  depend  on  the  level  of  computer 
knowledge of the person in charge of the procedure. 
 
65. The discs, whether magnetic (see point 3.2.1.1.a) or electronic (see point 3.2.1.1.b) 
have  different  areas.  Some  of  these  areas  are  a  priori  inaccessible  to  software 
independent of the hardware, to the operating system or to the BIOS/UEFI38, which 
makes it impossible to clean the entire storage areas of the medium. 
 
66. \\ Among these areas that are apparently inaccessible, we find: 

 Bad/unmapped/corrupted sectors 

 Over-provisioned space 

 Trimmed cells 

 Device Configuration Overlay (DCO) 

 Host Protected Area (HPA) 

 Garbage Collection (GC) 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 

 

37 Note that the term “erasure” is regularly used in the literature on the subject or in the description of 
software used for the secure deletion of digital information. 
38 BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is firmware stored on a memory chip and used to perform hardware 
initialisation  during  the  boot  process  and  to  provide  runtime  services  for  operating  systems  and 
programs. It is non-volatile, which means that its settings are saved and recoverable even after the device 
is turned off. As for UEFI, it is essentially an improved version of the BIOS.

3.2.1.1. Clear level - Third party software 

A. Magnetic hard drives 

67. \\ The clear level can be achieved for hard disks (internal and external) and floppy 
disks  using third-party software39, independent of  the  hardware,  such  as BitRaser, 
Blancco  Drive  Erasure,  PartedMagic,  Active@KillDisk  or  the  open  source  project 
DBAN. These software often offer a wide range of different protocols (up to several 
dozen) from which the uninformed user will find it difficult to choose. 
 
68. What differentiates these different protocols is, on the one hand, the number of 
overwrites, i.e. the number of successive overwrite passes that the surface of the disk 
will undergo and, on the other hand, the last stage of the protocol, i.e. the control of 
the effect of the overwrite passes. 
 
69. For  example,  the  DoD  5220.22-M  protocol,  very  often  used  and  present  in  all 
flagship software on the market, recommends writing on all addressable spaces of 
the medium, a binary character (in this case 0), then its complement (1) and finally a 
random binary character (0/1). The verification of the result is the last step40 of the 
protocol. 
 
70. The version of this “erase” protocol, still perceived as a true standard and which is 
delivered  in  most  third-party  software,  corresponds  to  an  obsolete  version  of  a 
standard of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) 41. The triple overwriting 
of  the  disk  required  by  this  old  version  of  the  protocol  is  more  than  sufficient  to 
prevent the recovery of data by commercially available software (clear level). While 
the effectiveness of the erasure protocols seems logically and a priori linked to the 
number of overwrite passes  that all the areas of the disk will have undergone, this 
logic is exceeded. 
 
71. In fact, in recent years, a consensus has emerged (NIST, HMG British Standard, 
BSI-GS,  CMRR42)  to  assert  that,  following  the  technological  evolution  of  media  (in 
particular  linked  to  the  increase  in  their  density  and  therefore  their  capacity),  the 
number  of  overwrite  passes  can  be  reduced  to  1,  without,  however,  increasing the 
possibility  of  recovering  the  data  on  the  disk  from  logical  solutions.  However,  a 
verification pass must be performed. 
 
72. If a write pass and a verification pass are sufficient (except for old hardware dating 
from before 2000 or of unknown age), we can then conclude that a protocol offering

or “data sanitization” to find information on paid software or freeware offering this type of function. 

40  In  the  literature,  it  is  mostly  referred  to  as  a  pass.  Thus,  DoD  5220.22-M  is  a  4-pass  protocol,  3 
dedicated to writing (erase/overwrite) and one to verification. 

41  To  be  precise,  the  current  version  of  this  protocol  no  longer  specifies  these  steps  and  thus  these 
software refer to an older version of the protocol. For more information: https://www.blancco.com/blog-

42 Extract from the “Tutorial on Disk Drive Data Sanitization” (p.8) of the Center for Magnetic Resonance 
Research (CMRR): “The U.S. National Security Agency published an Information Assurance Approval of 
single pass overwrite, after technical testing at CMRR showed that multiple on-track overwrite passes 
gave no additional erasure.”

3 overwrite passes and a final verification, or a verification after each write pass (such 
as the older version of the popular DoD 5220.22-M), is also sufficient.  
 
73. \\  On  the  other  hand,  although  they  are  not  strictly  discouraged,  the  protocols 
proposing a number of passes higher than a write pass and a verification pass can be 
qualified,  in the  current  state  of  our  knowledge  and  techniques  used,  as  not  being 
useful43. 

74. When it comes to choosing software, give preference to software that has been 
analysed  by  an  independent  laboratory  and/or  that  meets  the  requirements  of 
specialised government agencies.

B. Flash memory media 

76. Unlike  discs  and  floppy  disks  (see  previous  point  3.2.1.1.a),  which  are  magnetic 
media, flash memory is electronic media. This non-volatile memory (it is not erased in 
the absence of power, unlike the RAM for example) can be erased and reprogrammed 
electrically. 
 
77. Thanks in particular to falling prices, excellent performance and the absence of 
mechanical  breakdowns,  flash  memory  has  emerged  over  time  as  an  information 
storage technology that is increasingly present in electronic devices and information 
media. It can therefore be found in mobile phones, computers, digital cameras, USB 
keys, memory cards, SSDs (see below), calculators, medical devices, hi-tech toys, etc. 

 

43 The Gutmann (1996) protocol, reminiscent of a bygone past where the techniques used for writing to 
hard disks theoretically allowed specialised laboratories to find overwritten data, corresponds to no less 
than 35 overwrite passes plus a verification pass. Current hard disks have made this protocol, which is 
also  very  resource-intensive,  completely  obsolete*.  However,  it  still  appears  in  the  list  of  protocols 
offered by the main software on the market. 

*For specialists: this protocol has become obsolete at the same time as the appearance of high-density 
disks  (large  capacity)  and  the  technology  of  hard  disks  has  moved  from  MFM/RLL coding 
technique to PRML techniques in the late 90s.

78. \\ More specifically, as regards information media, we can distinguish  two large 
families of devices44 containing flash memory:  

 memory  cards of which  there are many types (e.g.: Secure Digital SD, SDHC, 
SDXC,  micro  and  mini  SD,  xD  card,  CompactFlash  or  MemoryStick).  They  are 
intended for small equipment such as digital cameras or mobile phones; 
 

 SSDs  or  solid-state  drives,  which  can  be  referred  to  as  static  disks, 
semiconductor  disks  or  simply  electronic  disks.  They  are  available  in  a  large 
number  of  formats  and  interfaces  (PCIe,  SATA,  USB,  etc.).  By  extension  of 
language,  any  type  of  medium  that  does  not  contain  ‘moving’  parts  (unlike 
rotating magnetic hard disks, for example) is sometimes called SSD (RAM, ROM, 
Smart Cards, Flash). 
 
NB: For several years now, SSDs have all been based on flash memory (hence the 
confusion between the two terms) but this has not always been the case (RAM) 
and this may change again in the future. 
 

ATA or SCSI Solid-State Drives (SSD) 

79. We have seen that certain areas of ‘traditional’ hard disks (see point 3.2.1.1.a) are 
inaccessible  to  third-party  software.  It  should  be  noted  that  for  flash  memory,  a 
technological  peculiarity  (see  par. 81 and 82) 
linked  to  this  type  of  medium 
accentuates this access problem. 
 
80. This is why, even if the use of independent software for the ‘electronic’ disks could 
make it possible to achieve the ‘clear’ level of confidentiality  via an  overwrite pass 
(especially via several), the use of these third-party software alone will be considered 
insufficient to achieve the desired objective. 
 
81. For information, the technological peculiarity mentioned in par. 79 is due to the 
fact  that  any  writing  on  this  type  of  medium  causes  wear.  Its  components  are 
therefore only guaranteed by the manufacturer for a finite number of program / erase 
cycles  or  p/e  cycles. \\  In  order  to  extend  the life  of  flash  memories  and  avoid  any 
premature wear of the cells of certain blocks45 compared to others46, manufacturers 
have  developed  strategies  such  as  wear-levelling47,  dedicated  file  systems  or  the 

 

44 https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9moire_flash#Grandes_familles 

45 Flash memories are divided into blocks which are made up of pages, themselves made up of memory 
cells. Writing and reading are done at the page level. However, before being able to overwrite in the same 
place, it is necessary to reset (erase) the memory cells, which is only done by whole block (generally made 
up of several hundred pages). You will therefore have to copy the entire block to another location, delete 
the original block, then write the contents of the old block with the new pages.  

46 In this case, avoid premature wear of the blocks which are often erased compared to those which store 
data which are not or only slightly modified.  

47 The principle is to copy data that are never or rarely modified on already worn cells, in order to distribute 
more uniformly the number of erasures/writes per cell (and therefore the wear).

exclusive  allocation  of  storage  spaces  to  the  SSD  controller  (overprovisioning)48. 
 
82. The use of these techniques therefore results in the copying of the same data in 
multiple locations, including areas to which independent software do not have access 
(examples: bad blocks or wear-levelling blocks). 

USB keys 

83. Known by many other names49 and whose flash memory is of lower quality than 
that of SSDs, they have, just like memory cards50 intended for small equipment (e.g.: 
digital cameras and mobiles phones), the same limitations at the clear level as SSD 
disks. 

C. Important points 

84. Remember that in the context of the overwriting of media by third party software 
(clear level): 

 The level of confidentiality reached does not exceed the clear level; 

 These software does not have, a priori, access to all the writing areas of the 

 

medium; 
 

 For  flash  memory  media,  creating  copies  of  data  blocks  increases  the 

possibilities for recovery after erasure. 
 

85. This is why, depending on the risk (mainly incurred by the data subjects), it may be 
necessary to combine the  erasure  with  another  technique  such  as  encryption  (see 
par. 126) or physical destruction (see chapter 3.2).  

3.2.1.2. Purge level - Integrated commands 

86. Storage  media  have  different  interfaces  depending  on  the  model  (ATA,  SCSI, 
NVMe). These interfaces, used to communicate between host systems and storage 
devices, have different types of commands for cleaning the medium. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

48 The use of these techniques and the absence of mechanical parts nevertheless allow current SSDs to 
obtain guarantees equivalent to hard drives.

USB stick, USB memory or USB flash drive.

A. IDE/ATA magnetic hard drives 

87. Most modern IDE/ATA51  (PATA525353,  eSATA,  etc. 
included)  hard  disks53 are 
delivered  with  “Secure  Erase”  commands (generalised  since  2001  for  disks  over 
15GB). Secure Erase is the name given to a set of commands stored in and available 
from the firmware54 on the disk. 
 
88. These  built-in commands55 erase  (overwrite)  all  the  data  on  a  disk  (including 
sectors marked bad or inaccessible) and achieve a purge level of confidentiality. 
 
89. \\ Third-party software differs from those discussed in section 3.2.1.1.: HDDerase. 
Developed  by  the  CMRR42,  this  utility  indeed  incorporates  the  ATA  Secure  Erase 
command and can therefore reach certain storage areas inaccessible  to traditional 
third-party software. 
 
90. \\ Also note under Linux, the command line program ‘hdparm’ (NB: the programs 
GParted and Parted Magic both include hdparm). 

ATA commands - details 

91. So  far  we  have  discussed  the Secure  Erase  “command”.  It  is  the  term  most 
frequently  used in the literature but also one that  is regularly used in an  imprecise 
manner. 
 
92. The  correct  name  of  the  command  is  ‘Security  Erase  Unit’  (one  of  the  ATA 
standard commands)  and  is available in two modes, the standard ‘Secure Erase’ or 
‘Normal Erase’ mode and the ‘Enhanced Secure Erase’ or ‘Enhanced Erase’ mode. 
 
93. The  ‘enhanced’  mode,  which  targets  sectors  that  are  no  longer  in  use  due  to 
reallocation, is not supported by all ATA media. 
 
94. Although  their  names  are  similar,  there  are  differences  between  these  two 
modes. When the normal erase mode is selected, the ‘Security Erase Unit’ command 
writes zeros (in binary) in all areas where data has been written by the user. 
 
95. When the enhanced erase mode is selected, the ‘Security Erase Unit’ command 
writes data according to predefined patterns and also overwrites the disk sectors that 
are no longer in use or marked as inaccessible to the user. The use of this mode is 

51 To be distinguished from ATA SSD (solid-state drives). 

 

52 IDE is a standard interface, also known by the acronym ATA, used to connect storage devices (hard 
disks,  CD/DVD  drives,  etc.)  to  the  motherboard  of  a  PC.  Although  the  name  IDE  is  often  used 
interchangeably with ATA, IDE actually refers only to the electrical specifications of the signals on the 
40/80 pin drive cable. ATA is the correct name for the entire specification. 

53 When SATA (Serial AT Attachment), the new ATA standard for data transmission emerged, the old, 
well-known forms of ATA were retroactively renamed PATA (Parallel ATA). 
54  Firmware  is  software  embedded  in  hardware,  which  provides  the  instructions  necessary  for  the 
operation of the same hardware. 

55 These commands (firmware commands) cannot be run on a hard disk like, for example, commands in 
Windows are run from command prompt. To run the Secure Erase commands, you will need to use a 
program which gives direct access (I/O) to the ATA interface of the hard disk and which allows sending 
ATA commands to this same drive. Even so, the user will often not run the command manually.

optional and is not supported by all manufacturers. However, if it is available, it will be 
preferred to the standard mode. 
 
96. From  the  point  of  view  of  the  ATA  specification,  these  are  two  different 
commands  and  it  is  sometimes  difficult  to  know  which  one  is  used  by  the 
manufacturers. Likewise, if a medium says it implements both uses, it is possible that 
it combines both with a single action/version.  
 
97. More  recently,  another  ATA  command,  ‘Sanitize  Device’,  has  emerged.  Also 
optional, it is not used on all the media. Just like the equivalent command for SCSI and 
NVMe56 interfaces (‘sanitize’,  see  par. 103),  it  consists  of  the  three  modes –  crypto 
scramble, block erase and overwrite – the latter attempting to clean up all areas of 
user data, including bad, spare, and unallocated blocks. 

 Overwrite57 allows the user to specify the overwrite pass(es) they want to apply 

(e.g.: 3 passes, the 2nd using the ‘invert’57 option and 3rd being identical to the 1st) 
 

 Crypto scramble initiates cryptographic erasure which modifies/removes the 

encryption keys from the medium (see section 3.2.4.): 
 

 Block erase is used to erase flash memory media. 

 

98. The command line software ‘hdparm’, already mentioned, integrates since 2016 
(v.9.49) the ‘Sanitize Device’ feature set. It offers an alternative for suspicious users 
who would rather not rely on manufacturer utilities (and their varying implementation 
of quality) to ‘sanitise’ their media. 
 
99. In order of preference, when they are supported by the data  medium, it will be 
preferable to use the ‘sanitize device’ command, then the ‘Enhanced Secure Erase’ 
mode  and  finally  the  ‘Secure  Erase’  mode  (both  modes  of  the  Security  Erase  Unit 
command). 

Secure Erase - confusion 

100. Some  devices  for  destroying  information  media  (see  chapter  3.3)  as  well  as 
some ‘sanitisation’ software include the words ‘secure erase’ in their name or indicate 
that they are securely erasing data from a hard disk.  
 
101. However, unless these devices and software specifically state that they use the 
‘Secure Erase’ mode of the ATA ‘Security Erase Unit’ command, this is likely not the 
case.  In  other  words,  although  many  data  erasure  techniques  can  be  considered 
‘secure’ compared to a simple delete, not all of them include the ‘ATA Secure Erase 
Unit’ command, which is the only way to reach the purge level of confidentiality and 
therefore lead to an effectively secure erasure. 
 

 

56 The ‘Sanitize’ command for the NVMe interface also has the three modes – block erase, crypto erase 
and overwrite. 
57 The ‘overwrite ext’ mode fills the user data area with a four-byte pattern. The settings for this mode 
include  a  number  of  multiple  overwrites  and  the  ability  to  invert  the  four-byte  pattern  between 
consecutive overwrite passes (‘Invert’ setting).

102. If  necessary,  when  choosing  software,  the  reader  will  pay  attention  to  this 
point. \\ Examples include Secure Eraser and the online command SDelete58 (Secure 
Delete), which may appear to support Secure Erase, but do nothing. Remember that 
programs like HDDErase (see par.89) or hdparm (see par. 90) are examples of free 
programs that use Secure Erase.  

B. Magnetic SCSI hard drives 

103. Most SCSI59 hard  disks60 (Parallel  SCSI,  Serial  Attached  SCSI,  Fiber  Channel, 
USB Attached Storage and SCSI Express included61) support (are supplied with) the 
‘sanitize’62 command. 
 
104. Like  the  equivalent  command  for  ATA  and  NVMe  interfaces,  the  sanitize 
command, with the overwrite option, performs one or more overwrite passes on all 
addressable63 areas of the disk and allows the purge level of confidentiality. The other 
two options (‘block erase’ and ‘cryptographic erase’) are also similar to those of the 
ATA and NVMe interfaces. 

C. Common notes for ATA and SCSI hard drives 

105. The result of these dedicated commands, issued from the disk manager64 itself, 
is especially more reliable65 than the use of third-party software (see Article 3.2.1.1.) 
because the manufacturer knows its hardware well and these commands take into 
account  all  the  writable  areas66 of  the  medium which  are  invisible  to the  operating 
system and the BIOS/UEFI. This technique is also faster than third-party software. In 

 

58  SDelete is  part  of  the  suite  of  tools for  administration  and  troubleshooting  of  ‘sysinternals’  for 
Windows. 
Extract  from  the documentation of  the  'sysinternals'  tools:  “Secure  delete  applications  overwrite  a 
deleted file's on-disk data using techniques that are shown to make disk data unrecoverable, even using 
recovery technology that can read patterns in magnetic media that reveal weakly deleted files. SDelete 
(Secure Delete) is such an application. You can use SDelete both to securely delete existing files, as well 
as to securely erase any file data that exists in the unallocated portions of a disk (including files that you 
have already deleted or encrypted).”  
59 To be distinguished from SCSI SSD (solid-state drives). 

60 SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) is a set of standards describing the physical connection and 
transfer of data between computers and devices. SCSI standards define commands, protocols, electrical, 
optical and logical interfaces. 

61 Some interfaces do not comply with all of the SCSI standards but nevertheless use the SCSI command 
protocol. 

62  For  a  full  description  of  SCSI  commands:  https://www.t10.org  - SCSI  Block  Commands (T10/BSR 
INCITS 506 - Rev.22 15/09/2020) 
63 Zone receiving a unique address (identifying its location on the medium) in order to be accessible in 
read/write (sector). 
64  Tool  for  performing  the  usual  disk  administration  tasks  such  as  formatting,  managing  partitions 
(creation, deletion, sizing, etc.), changing the letter of a drive, etc. 
65  It  seems  that  in  some  cases  (for  which  it  is  difficult  to  assess  the  frequency)  and  at  least  for  ATA 
interfaces,  these  commands  are  not  or  have  not  always  been  correctly  implemented  by  some 
manufacturers.  http://www.hddoracle.com/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=1412 . 

66 Most hard drives support the creation of hidden storage spaces that are not known to the operating 
system or BIOS. There are 2 examples: the Host Protected Area (HPA) and the Device Configuration 
Overlay (DCO).  https://site.aleratec.com/blog/2011/03/31/remember-hpa-dco-sanitizing-hard-drives/

addition, the integrated commands are also less susceptible to malware attacks than 
third-party software. 
 
106. Knowing that some problematic implementations of the sanitize command have 
been reported 65, whether the erasure is done using third-party software or through 
an integrated command, it will always be necessary to verify the proper execution of 
the instructions67, i.e., whether the command has resulted in the expected erasure. 

D. Solid State Drives (SSD) 

107. As with magnetic hard disks, most manufacturers generally provide software for 
use  with  their  SSD  media  (ATA,  SCSI  and  NVM  Express  interfaces)  including  a 
firmware update tool 54, the secure erase68 commands and optionally a media cloning 
tool. 
 
108. \\ For example, the reader will find below the links to SSD tools of some well-
known vendors: 

 Samsung Magician  (secure erase is available in the Data Management section) 

 Western Digital SSD Dashboard  (secure erase and sanitize are available in the 

 

Drive Management section) 
 

 Seagate: SeaTools SSD GUI  (with graphical user interface/GUI - secure erase is 
available in Operations - Maintenance - Erase) and SeaTools SSD CLI (without GUI 
- the sanitize command provides block-erase and overwrite options) 
 

 Lenovo ThinkPad Drive Erase Utility: This utility resets the cryptographic key of 
the supported hard disks (HDD) (Full Disk Encryption - FDE, see Article 3.2.4.2.) 
and erases the solid state drive (SSD). 
 

109. The manufacturer's website is the first place to look for a suitable secure erase 
tool.  However,  these  tools  do  not  always  allow  the  execution  of  the  integrated 
commands or if they do, the quality of the result of their execution is uncertain. 
 
110. Therefore,  in  view  of  the  characteristics  of  SSDs  and  the  above,  in  order  to 
achieve  a  sufficient  level  of  security/confidentiality,  it  will  be  recommended  to 
perform an additional ‘sanitisation’ using a different technique69. 

 
 

 

67 Third-party software generally allow you to include a verification pass, the safest option being the use 
of specialised software, such as data recovery tool or disk editor. 

68 In practice, when the secure erase command is executed, the SSD controller simultaneously applies an 
electrical voltage to all the storage cells and resets them (release of the stored electrons). The command 
therefore does not write anything to the medium. 
69 In this case for ATA, we will follow a block erase by an overwrite and cryptographic erase by a secure 
erase. For SCSI, we will execute a sanitize-block erase after a cryptographic erase and finally for NVM 
Express, we will launch the user data erase command after a cryptographic erase.

3.2.2. Anonymisation 
111.  \\ Anonymisation, which makes it impossible to re-identify data subjects, is less 
and  less  possible  to  ensure  as  access  to  increasingly  large  and  online  databases 
intensifies. 
 
112. \\ Therefore, this technique will not be considered as having a sufficient level of 
confidentiality/security.  And  this  is  regardless  of  the  resources  (time  and  human) 
needed  for  its  execution,  which  further  reduce  its  benefit  compared  to  other 
techniques. 
 
113. If  anonymisation  has  already  been  carried  out,  before  any  transfer  of  an 
information medium, the validity of the method used must have been examined and a 
re-identification test carried out, preferably by personnel independent of the person 
who carried out the anonymisation (which will be all the more justified if the quantities 
of data on the medium are large). 
 
114. Finally, let us not forget that modifying the data contained on a medium (values 
in a database for example) does not necessarily delete them from the medium (no 
overwriting of the data). 

3.2.3. Degaussing 
115. Degaussing involves applying a magnetic force of sufficient strength to erase all 
data from a particular magnetic medium. The effectiveness of this technique is linked 
to the relative strength of the magnetic force offered by the degaussing device and 
to the magnetic properties of the data medium. 
 
116. Although it is an important technique for cleaning magnetic media, the reader will 
be able to infer from the above that degaussing is not effective, given their nature, on 
most  flash  memory  devices,  including  SSDs.  This  is  because  they  use  integrated 
circuits to store data instead of storing it magnetically. Nor will it be used on mixed 
information media consisting of at least one non-volatile, non-magnetic medium. 
 
117. This underlines the need for a correct inventory of the media, indicating their type 
and  the associated sanitisation  method, because if  care is not taken to distinguish 
SSDs from hard drives during degaussing, the data stored on SSDs will be left intact. 
 
integrate  both  types  of  media 
118. Let  us not forget that  some  devices  can 
(electronic and magnetic). If degaussing is considered for these hybrid devices, care 
will also be taken to apply a sanitisation technique suitable for the electronic storage 
medium. 

119. The ideal inventory (see  chapter  2.3.)  should  mention  the  degaussing  force 
necessary for the ‘sanitisation’ of the medium, i.e. its coercivity31. In fact, the coercivity 
can  be  difficult  to  determine  based  only  on  the  information  on  the  product  label. 
Therefore, it may be helpful to consult the device manufacturer beforehand for this 
information. 
 
120. It is important to always ensure that adequate power is applied to the media (too 
strong, the medium risks being rendered unusable, and too weak, the data may not be 
properly ‘sanitised’), and especially ensure that the required power evolves with the 
technology.  In  fact,  the  coercivity  of  the  media 
increases  along  with  their 

 

Information media erasure and destruction guide | Version 1.01 - 23/03/2021  

30 

30 

 

density/capacity70. Newer and larger capacity media therefore require more powerful 
degaussers. 
 
121. Depending  on  the  intensity  of  the  degaussing,  the  medium  may  be  rendered 
unusable. In this case, degaussing also becomes a destruction technique (see section 
3.3.5.). In the same vein, degaussing could also be considered in the case of a damaged 
medium which can no longer be ‘sanitised’ by a method requiring the operation of the 
medium. 
 
122. As  not  all  degaussers  work  in  the  same  manner,  it  will  be  necessary  to 
ensure that  the  operators  who  use  them know  their  specific  operating  modes.  For 
example, some devices require only a single pass while others require multiple passes, 
and some models require the information media to be disassembled while others do 
not. 
 
123. For your information, the NSA publishes an updated list of degaussers to safely 
‘sanitise’  magnetic tapes  and  hard  drives.  The  devices  listed  in  this document71 are 
listed against the coercivity of the storage device that they can safely erase. 

3.2.4. Cryptographic erase (crypto-erase - CE) 
124. It  is  the  last  of  the  “sanitisation”  techniques  preserving  the  medium  which  is 
presented  because,  although  it is  a technique  in  its  own  right,  it  is  often  used  as  a 
complement to others. 
 
125. The aim of the methods presented in this document is, ultimately, to make the 
data contained on a medium permanently inaccessible. Data encryption72 can, at first 
glance, also achieve this objective by making these data unintelligible to anyone who 
does  not  have  access  to  the  decryption  key.  It  is  this  additional  step,  i.e.  the  final 
destruction  of  the  key  allowing  the  decryption,  which  constitutes  the  difference 
between  encryption  and  cryptographic  erasure  and  allows  this  technique  to  be  a 
“sanitisation” technique. 
 
126. Encryption  is  of  course  very  useful  in  many  other  data  protection  cases.  It  is 
indeed a significant measure to counter a loss of confidentiality, in the event of theft, 
unauthorised  access  or  loss  of  the  medium.  Encryption  is  also  mentioned  in  the 
GDPR73, as a potential means of mitigating the risks for data subjects, and in certain 

 

70 In order to increase the magnetic storage density, the area allocated to each bit must be reduced. For 
this, it is necessary to use magnetic materials with increased coercivity to prevent the information from 
being  erased  due  to  interactions  with  nearby  bits.  This  makes  bit  recording  more  difficult  because  it 
requires a higher magnetic field. This also explains why with the increase in capacities, it becomes more 
difficult to degauss (the power required increases) the media concerned.

72 Encrypting an information medium is usually based on an authentication key and a data encryption key. 
The encryption key is the key with which data is actually encrypted and decrypted. The authentication 
key relies on the user's password or passphrase and is used to decrypt the data encryption key (which in 
turn decrypts the data). With this two-level approach, the user can thus change their password without 
having to encrypt all their data again, because the encryption key remains unchanged (it will have to be 
re-encrypted using the user’s new password). 
73  Encryption  is  mentioned  in  Articles  6§4.e  (lawfulness),  Article  32§1.a  (security)  and  Article  34§3.a 
(communication to the data subject) of the GDPR.

cases  exempting  from  the  communication  of  a  data  breach  to  data  subjects 
(Art.34.3.a of the GDPR)74. But this is outside the scope of the analysis covered by this 
document. 

3.2.4.1. Integrated commands

this 

technique 

127. Both  the  ATA/IDE  (crypto  scramble  option)  and  SCSI  (cryptographic  erase 
option) command groups discussed in Article 3.2.1.2., include specific commands that 
enable cryptographic erasure of data located on the medium. However, they are not 
implemented on all media from all manufacturers. 
 
(guidelines  SP.880-88r1) 
128. If 
recommends overwriting  the  medium  subsequently,  either  through  the  other 
integrated  commands  or  using  third-party  software  (see  Article  3.2.1.1.).  This  is  to 
reduce the potential risk generated by a decryption key still present and accessible on 
the medium following an ineffective or absent destruction. 
 
129. NB: we have seen  (par.92) that two  distinct ATA  commands, bearing a similar 
name, existed and presented differences for overwrite operations (Secure Erase and 
Enhanced Secure Erase). When used for media encryption, whether one or the other 
is used, they will produce the same result.

used, 

3.2.4.2. SEDs 

130. Many information media contain integrated “self-encryption” mechanisms. This 
is  generally  referred  to  as  hardware-based  full  disk  encryption  (FDE)  and  more 
particularly  self-encrypting  devices (SEDs75),  when  it  comes  to  hard  disks  or  solid 
state drives (SSD). Self-encryption means that all the data written to the medium is 
encrypted by the medium before it is written and decrypted by the medium when it is 
read76. The encryption key is known only to the medium, but it can nevertheless be 
changed by an authorised user. If the key is modified, any data previously written with 
the initial key becomes unreadable. The key can therefore be changed to ‘destroy’ the 
data by making them irrecoverable (unreadable). 
 
131. The  cryptographic  erasure  technique  is  therefore  easy  and  above  all  quick  to 
perform on the SEDs since the encryption phase has already been performed. 
 

 

74 Article 34.3.a of the GDPR: The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 shall not 
be  required  if  any  of  the  following  conditions  are  met:  a)  the controller has  implemented  appropriate 
technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data 
affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to 
any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;” 
75 For example, here is the link to the detailed technical guide (EN) on the security implementation and 
full encryption of Seagate SED models: 

https://www.seagate.com/files/staticfiles/support/docs/manual/Interface%20manuals/100515636c.p
df. 

76 In practice, for FDE media, data are always encrypted (via the data encryption key) when stored on the 
medium, even if there is no defined password (in the case, for example, of a new disk or of a user who 
does not wish to set a password). 

Information media erasure and destruction guide | Version 1.01 - 23/03/2021

132. The  SEDs  which  comply  with  the OPAL77  standard of  the Trusted  Computing 
Group78  use  the  AES79 (Advanced  Encryption  Standard) encryption  algorithm with 
128- or 256-bit keys. For these media, cryptographic erasure is called “PSID Revert” 
because  it  requires,  before  launching  the  command  itself  and  erasing  the  keys,  a 
unique ID specific to each medium to be entered: the PSID80 or Physical Security ID. 

3.2.4.3. Security vulnerabilities of SEDs 

133. \\  Another  important  point  lies  in  the  publication  of  a study   highlighting  a 
security flaw in the integrated “self-encryption” mechanism of SSDs and allowing this 
encryption to be bypassed if one has physical access to the information medium. 
 
134. Depending  on  the  risk  analysis,  a  software  encryption  solution,  such  as  open 
source  software VeraCrypt (for  Windows,  Mac  OSX  and  Linux)  and LUKS (Linux 
Unified Key Setup), may be preferred to the hardware-based solution. 
 
135. It should be noted that some manufacturers take these potential violations of 
SSD disks into account and issue warnings (e.g.: Samsung). 

3.2.4.4. Important points 

136. This technique (encryption followed by cryptographic erasure) can be used on 
other media (which are not SEDs or do not support integrated commands), by using 
third-party  encryption  software  and  by  permanently  deleting  the  keys,  once  the 
encryption is complete. The prior encryption of the medium can, however, be a very 
time-consuming process (several hours, depending on the capacity of the medium, its 
write/read speed and the computing power allocated to the operation). 
 
137. In contrast, the on-the-fly encryption of SEDs makes the cryptographic erasure 
technique very fast and almost immediately prevents access to the data contained on 
the medium. 
 
138. In  the  case  of  cryptographic  erasure,  it  is  also  necessary  to  be  sure  that  no 
personal data has been written before the on-the-fly encryption because these will 
not be protected by the cryptographic erasure. 
 
139. In the risk analysis prior to choosing this technique, the manager will have to take 
into account future technological developments which may make current encryption 
methods less secure. 
 

 

77 A set of specifications for self-encrypting drives developed by the TCG to protect the confidentiality 
of stored data. 

78 The TCG is a group of companies created to develop and promote trusted computing standards and 
technologies  which  must  allow  hardware  manufacturers  to  have  control  over  what  can  run  on  their 
systems and refuse non-validated (unsigned) software to be run. Its members include Western Digital, 
Samsung, Seagate, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell or Microsoft. 

79 The AES encrypts the plaintext, in blocks of 128 bits at a time, using symmetric keys of 128, 192, or 256 
bits. A symmetric key is a key which is used both to encrypt a text and to decrypt this same text. 

80 The PSID is a unique identifier consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters that is most often printed on 
the medium label.

33 

33 

 

140. The encryption operation, performed to prevent access to the data contained on 
the medium, must be carried out according to a procedure validated by the controller.  

3.2.4.5. Risks 

141. Once encrypted, the data, although saved in another form, is still present on the 
medium. The use of this technique therefore implies that the encryption algorithm is 
sufficiently robust to resist decryption without knowledge of the key and, on the other 
hand, that the initial key (i.e. before its modification/destruction ) is not, in any way, 
recoverable, both on the medium itself and elsewhere (also consider any backups). 
These requirements are common to techniques using encryption. 
 
142. This procedure will provide that: 

 The  encryption  algorithm  used  is  recognised  and  secure81,82 (do  not  use  an 

obsolete algorithm such as DES or 3DES for example); 
 

 The encryption keys used are of sufficient length 83,82; 

 

 The encryption keys used are managed correctly (they are not on the medium 

and in any case, not in plain text); 
 

 Encryption is either applied to the entire media or to a logical subdivision of it 

(as opposed to encryption of individual directories or files). 
 
Note that most modern encryption techniques meet these requirements. 
 

143. Along with the risks associated with technological developments, cryptographic 
erasure, or more precisely encryption, also presents intrinsic risks linked to a possible 
weakness  of  the  password  protecting  the authentication key (if  applicable),  the 
presence of keys in memory,  the existence of unencrypted data in temporary files or 
even the weakness of the encryption protocol used. In addition, the certainty that the 
encryption  keys  are  indeed  made  permanently  inaccessible,  can  be  difficult  to 
establish84. 
 
144. Finally, note that, with regard to inaccessible areas of the medium, hardware-
independent  encryption  software  is  subject  to  the  same  limitations  as  third-party 
‘sanitisation’ software (see Article 3.2.1.1.). 
 
145. Therefore, like the NIST, we recommend carrying out, following a cryptographic 
erase, an erasure/overwriting of the medium (with verification). This is particularly to 

 

81 \\ For example, Appendix B1 of the general security reference system published by ANSSI recommends 
the AES symmetric encryption mechanism (links in Appendix C). 

82  ENISA 
recommended algorithms, key lengths, encryption protocols and parameters on its website. 

(European  Union  Agency  for  Cybersecurity)  also  publishes documents relating  to 

83  \\  For  example,  Appendix  B1  of  the  general  security  reference  system  published  by  ANSSI 
recommends a minimum symmetric key size of 128 bits (links in Appendix C). 
84 On this subject, see section 4.7.3 (Verification of Sanitization Results) of the guidelines SP.880-88r1  of 
the NIST, where the specific case of cryptographic erase is discussed on p.21.

reduce the potential risk generated by a decryption key still present and accessible on 
the medium following an ineffective or absent destruction. 

Ideal situation 

146. In the best of all worlds, the manufacturers of SEDs or media  offering ‘secure 
erase’  commands  should  provide,  in  detail,  all  the  necessary  information  on  the 
commands implemented and above all guarantee the result of the erasure, preferably 
contractually.  Moreover,  nothing  prevents  the  controller  from  requesting  written 
assurances on this subject when purchasing these media. 
 

3.3. The data medium is destroyed 

147. It should be noted from the outset that there are a number of cases where the 
physical  destruction  of  the 
its 
‘sanitisation’: 

information  medium  should  be  preferred  to 

 If the media is defective; 

 If the drive is defective; 

 If the equipment required to access the data is no longer available; 

 

 

 

 If the media type makes ‘sanitisation’ impossible, such as WORM media (write 

once, read many - example: write once CD-ROM); 
 

 If the verification step that closes the purge or clear methods does not give safe 

results or it fails (for known or unknown reasons). 
 

148. Regardless of environmental concerns, it may be more economical to destroy 
media than to ‘sanitise’ them for reuse. 
 
149. Finally, it should be noted that chemical destruction will not be considered in this 
document. Even if certain chemical agents are capable of attacking data media and 
destroying them, this rarely used technique is also dangerous for health and harmful 
for the environment. 

3.3.1. Segmentation of techniques 

150. A) Certain destruction techniques only partially damage the medium. 

 As a result, the data stored on intact parts can remain accessible. This is the 

case with the deformation techniques discussed in the following section 3.3.2. 
 

151. B)  Other  techniques,  such  as  shredding,  crushing  or  disintegration  break  the 
medium into pieces (see section 3.3.3.). 

 It is important to realise that in this case too, the data are still present on the 
targeted medium. They are simply divided into smaller parts. Given that a hard 
disk can contain several terabytes of data, a fragment of a hard disk tray, barely 
one cm2 in size, can still contain several gigabytes of data. 

Information media erasure and destruction guide | Version 1.01 - 23/03/2021  

35 

35 

 

 

 The level of security/confidentiality provided by a fragmentation of the medium 
will be linked to the size of the fragments obtained. The smaller the fragments, 
the more resources and time it will take to reconstruct the data. This link (size of 
fragments  -  security/confidentiality)  is  at the core  of  the  DIN  66399  standard, 
discussed in section 3.3.6. 

152. C)  Finally,  a  3rd  group  of  techniques  allows  the  complete  destruction  of  the 
medium and  especially of the data it contains. 

 The result is achieved by changing the state of the support, i.e. by changing it 
from  the  solid  state  to  the  gaseous  state  (sublimation)  or  to  the  liquid  state 
(melting). 
 

3.3.2. Physical deformation 

large  number  of  different  techniques  are  covered  by  the  term 
153. A 
‘physical deformation85  techniques’.  They  can  be 
large 
industrial devices, and by common tools such as a hammer, a compressed air nailer, a 
drill or even a press. 
 
154. These techniques include in particular: 

implemented,  both  by 

 Folding / bending; 

 Cutting; 

 And drilling / puncturing / punching / piercing. 

 

 

 

155. Benders  use  a  metal  wedge  to  bend  a  medium  (mostly  hard  drives)  along  its 
length at a 90 degree angle. The metal wedge, pressed with great force, damages the 
platters, read heads, electric motor and electronics of the hard disk such that it is no 
longer accessible through its interface. 
 
156. With regard to puncturing, while you immediately think of a technician using his 
drill to make holes in a hard disk, this is not the method recommended by the ITAD 
sector (IT Asset Disposition).  There are machines for implementing this method. A 
hole punch uses a hardened steel pin to pierce through the media. When drilling a hard 
drive, the platters, read heads, electric motor and electronics are damaged such that 
it is no longer accessible through its interface.  
 
157. Some devices offer an optional module that can also destroy SSD (Solid State 
Drive) by puncturing. Depending on the model, the SSD is pierced in several places 
with metal pins or cracked in a wave shape. 
 
158. The common factor in these techniques is that they only partially damage the 
medium  and  leave  the  data  stored  on  the  parts  not  affected  by  the  deformation 
accessible.

159. As a result, these techniques do not achieve the destroy level of confidentiality, 
even  though  they  may  make  the  data  impossible  to  retrieve  through  the  media 
interface and the media cannot be used for subsequent storage. The medium is in fact 
not considered ‘destroyed’ as long as data recovery is possible, even if this requires 
state-of-the-art laboratory techniques. 
 
160. As confirmation, in its reference document86 on the subject, the NSA (National 
Security  Agency  of  the  United  States)  cites  deformation  techniques  only  as 
complementary but nevertheless highly recommended measures87, to degaussing of 
magnetic hard drives. Deformation alone is therefore not validated by the NSA as a 
‘sanitisation’ method. 

3.3.3. Shredding, crushing and disintegration88 

161. While these techniques are different, all three result in the breaking down of the 
medium, transforming it into smaller components. The size of the debris will depend 
on the technique, the materials making up the medium and technical characteristics 
of the device used for this. 
 
162. Shredders, for  example,  come  in  a  wide  range  of  sizes  and  depending  on  the 
model, can shred just about anything from tyres to hard drives or SSDs, to paper or 
even  a  sofa.  The  average  size  of  the  debris  will  depend  on  the  model  while  their 
individual size will depend on the materials used in their composition. Thus, for a hard 
drive, the plastic  pieces of the case will especially be larger than  the pieces of the 
platters. 
 
163. The choice of one technique rather than another is secondary to the size of the 
debris  obtained.  This  is  why  we  will  not  dwell,  beyond  a  simple  description,  on  the 
techniques themselves. 
 
164. As specified by the ISO/IEC 21964 standard, “in this context (destruction of the 
medium),  securely  destroying  means  destroying  the  data  media  containing  the 
personal data, such that the recovery of information concerning them is impossible or 
is  only  possible  with  considerable  expenditure  (in  terms  of  personnel,  material 
resources and time)”. 

3.3.3.1. Shredding 

165. Shredders consist of juxtaposed cylinders carrying hardened steel knives, which 
rotate in opposite directions to cut, tear and extrude materials. For the materials that 
we are specifically interested in, there are shredders that accept only thin media, such 
as  optical  media  (CD,  DVD,  Blu-Ray),  memory  media  (USB  keys,  memory  cards), 
magnetic tapes (audio, video, data), magnetic or chip cards of all types, while others 
also  accept  smartphones,  tablets,  hard  drives  and  possibly  SSDs  and  finally  other 
devices dedicated to paper destruction. 

 

86 NSA/CSS Storage Device Sanitization Manual  
87  However,  the  NSA  is  evaluating the  ability  of  some  devices  to  deform  the  platters  of  a  hard  drive 
(magnetic) in 30 seconds or less, by bending, punching or waffling. Devices meeting these criteria are 
covered in the document ‘NSA/CSS Evaluated Products List for Hard Disk Drive Destruction Devices’

166. A paper shredder is a mechanical device used to cut paper into strips or particles. 
Note that it can also be used to destroy flexible media such as floppy disks, once the 
media  are  physically  removed  from  their  outer  containers.  The  size  of  the  shreds 
should be small enough that there is reasonable assurance, commensurate with the 
confidentiality of the data, that the data cannot be reconstructed. To be approved by 
the NSA, paper shredders must be able to reduce paper documents into fragments 
measuring no more than one millimetre by five millimetres89. Disintegrators can also 
destroy paper documents (see par.178) 

Solid State Drives - SSDs 

167. Once  again,  note  that  hard  disks  (magnetic)  and  SSDs  (electronic)  have  very 
different technical characteristics and cannot, therefore, be ‘sanitised’/destroyed in 
the same way. 
 
168. Shredders not specifically suited for these media will produce debris too large to 
safely destroy data on high density semiconductor chips. 
 
169. The NSA security standards require that hard drives be reduced to a final particle 
size of two millimetres, i.e., be degaussed and then physically destroyed (shredders or 
crushers). This second option is not possible for SSDs. However, according to a study 
conducted  by  firm Blancco (Dec.  2018),  many  organisations  (33%  in  the  USA  and 
Canada) do not have a different process for handling these 2 types of media. 
 
170. With ever-increasing data storage density, the size of chips on SSDs is reducing. 
Shredding to sizes larger than these components can therefore leave the information 
on the media completely intact. 
 
171. To make the  reconstruction  of  the  data  even  more  difficult,  the  shredded 
material can be mixed with a non-sensitive material of the same type (shredded paper 
or shredded flexible media), with a larger amount of debris increasing the difficulty of 
reconstruction  accordingly.  This  is  also  valid  for  all  techniques  and  types  of 
destruction residues. 

3.3.3.2. Crushing 

172. Crushers use compressive force to crush the medium by breaking it into pieces 
(examples: between two jaws, one of which is fixed - jaw crusher or by percussion - 
impact crusher). 
 
173. The term crusher is sometimes used for “devices capable of reducing the data-
bearing  layer  of  an  optical  disc  to  fine  dust  while  leaving  the  disc  itself  intact  for 
recycling  or  disposal.  However,  this  method  cannot  be  used  for  DVDs  since  their 
information medium layer is sandwiched in the centre” (source: BCSS90). However, in 
this case it will be more of an abrasion technique. We will add that Blu-Ray discs have 
the same problem.

174. Still on the subject of optical media, let us note that the NSA also publishes, like 
for hard disks 87 and other types of media91, a list of devices validated92 for destruction 
by fragmentation. To be included, the devices must provide residues whose side does 
not exceed: 

 For CDs, a length of 5 millimetres; 

 For DVDs and Blu-Ray, a length of 2 millimetres. 

 

 

3.3.3.3. Disintegration 

175. The  term  disintegration/disintegrator  is  often  used  when  the  size  of  the 
fragments obtained is less than or equal to two millimetres per side. This size is related 
to  the  NSA  prescriptions,  mentioned  in  the  document NSA/CSS  Storage  Device 
Sanitzation  Manual.  If  the  hardware  has  been  tested  by  the  NSA  and  meets the 
requirements of the manual, it will be included in the NSA/CSS Evaluated Products 
List for Hard Disk Drive Destruction Devices. 
 
176. In parallel, it is recommended to disintegrate media (both HD and SSD) in batches 
with other storage devices. 
 
177. Disc disintegrators use  knife  milling  technology  to  cut  the  media  into  pieces 
continuously  until  the  pieces  are  small  enough  to  pass  through  a  waste  sieve  of 
specific  size.  Disintegration  is  slower  than  shredding  but  the  size  of  the  debris  is 
smaller and the level of security/confidentiality achieved is higher. 
 
178. Paper disintegrators (different from paper shredders - see par.166) must, to be 
approved by the NSA, produce shreds with sides no greater than three millimetres by 
five millimetres93. 

3.3.3.4. Notes 

179. Note that  translation  tools  are  not  very  precise,  and  can  produce  several 
different translations for the same technique in the same sentence. Websites dealing 
with the physical destruction of information media (including some manufacturers) 
also quite frequently mix up the names of devices and techniques, or even use names 
unrelated to the technology used (destroyer, disassembly device, cracker, etc.). 
 
180. We have seen, for example, that for an information medium such as hard disks 
and SSDs to be considered by the NSA as adequately ‘sanitised’ using a disintegration 
technique, two conditions must be met: the residues must be no more than 2mm on 
one side and the device used must be part of the list of approved devices (there are 
only American companies). This differs from the DIN 66399 standard.

181.  This  standard  specifies,  depending  on  the  size  of  the  residue,  what  level  of 
security  is  achieved  by  a  destruction  method,  for  six  major  classes  of  information 
media (e.g. paper, optical, electronic or magnetic); we will come back to this in section 
3.3.6. 
 
182. The controller will bear in mind that when it chooses to use an external service 
provider in order to dispose of its media using the techniques discussed in chapter 
3.3.,  once  the  destruction  has  been  carried  out,  this  service  provider  will  probably 
recycle them or deposit them in a landfill. 
 
183. This means that the data, if the media has not been securely destroyed, will again 
potentially be accessible to third parties. The remains of the media could even end up 
in  different  parts  of  the  world  if  they  are  sold  to  waste  management  or  recycling 
companies. Incineration eliminates this risk. 

3.3.4. Incineration  

184. Incineration, although more rarely used and having a significant environmental 
impact, is an effective technique because, if carried out  in suitable incinerators94, it 
alone guarantees the total and irreversible destruction of data and media. These can 
consist of large waste incinerators, as well as smaller mobile and compact incinerators 
that specialist companies can bring to the site of the controller who requests them. 
Some mobile models are dedicated to eliminating paper but others are also able to 
melt metal. 
 
185. As part of their digital transformation, many organisations digitise documents to 
store  them  online  or  archive  them  and  then  end  up  with  the  originals  for  disposal. 
When  quantities  of  paper  to  be  disposed  of  are  large,  incineration  can  be  an 
alternative to shredding. 
 
186. Other types of media can be destroyed by this technique. In its manual relating 
to  media  sanitisation,  the  NSA  cites  magnetic  tapes,  floppy  disks,  optical  media, 
electronic media and paper as being capable of being destroyed in a secure manner 
by  incineration,  provided  that  the  material  was  reduced  to  ashes.  Regarding  hard 
disks, it specifies that the lining of the internal platters must be reduced to ash and/or 
the internal platters must be physically deformed by the action of heat. 
 
187. If the incineration takes place outside the control of the controller, the latter will 
ensure that a processing of the media, offering a complete traceability chain, is set up 
by the external service provider(s). 

3.3.5. Degaussing 

188. Degaussing, already presented as a ‘sanitisation’ technique (with preservation of

189. It must be reiterated that degaussing is not effective on flash memory devices 
including SSDs. Likewise, this technique is not suitable for paper and optical media. 
 
190. Degaussing subjects magnetic media to a strong magnetic field which can be 
created either by strong magnets or by electromagnetic discharge. 
 
191. It  is  recommended  that  degaussing  be  followed  by  another  destruction 
technique.  This  will  help  to  achieve  the  highest  level  of  confidentiality/security, 
compensate  for  a  degausser  failure  or  an  oversight  on  the  technician’s  part,  and 
provide visual verification that the media has been destroyed and is ready for disposal. 
Under these conditions and with the use of an approved717196, the NSA validates the 
technique at the purge level. 

3.3.6. The DIN 66399 standard 

192. The DIN 66399 standard of Deutsches Institut für Normung, titled “Büro- und 
Datentechnik - Vernichten von Datenträgern”97 specifies, depending on the size of the 
debris resulting from the destruction of the medium, what level of security is reached 
by devices the intended use of which is to destroy data media. 
 
193. Very popular in Europe, it takes less account of the technique used than of the 
results thereof, for six major classes of information media. 
 
194. This standard (fee-based98) or more exactly this series of standards is made up 
of three parts99: 

 Part 1: Principles and definitions (publication 10/12); 

 Part 2: Requirements for equipment for destruction of data carriers (publication 

 Part 3: Process for destruction of data carriers (publication 02/13). 

 

 

10/12); 
 

195. Although  it  has  been  replaced  since  2012  by  the  DIN  66399  standard,  the 
classification100  related  to  the  obsolete  DIN  32357  standard  (1995),  which  applied 
exclusively to paper, is still often cited in the description of the devices concerned 
(mainly paper shredders). 
 
196. The  DIN  66399  standard  defines  protection  classes,  media  categories  and 
security levels.

100 The DIN 32757 standard defines 5 security levels. The literature also includes an unofficial 6th level 
‘Level  6  -  Highest  Security’.  These  security  levels  are  linked  to  the  fineness  of  the  shredding  of  the 
material and therefore express the level of security offered by the shredders.

Three protection classes 

197. They  determine  the  extent  to  which  data  should  be  protected,  based  on  an 
assessment  of  the  type  of  data  present  on  the  medium.  The  protection/security 
requirement is divided into normal, high and very high categories:  

 Protection class 1 - Normal security requirement for internal data. The loss of 
data would have a negative impact on the organisation or would present a risk of 
identity theft for the data subjects; 
 

 Protection class 2 - Higher security requirements for confidential data. The loss 
of data would have a very negative impact on the organisation or could violate its 
legal obligations or present a financial or social risk for the data subjects; 
 

 Protection class 3 - Very high protection requirements for very confidential and 
secret  data.  The  loss  of  data  could  have  irreparable  consequences  for  the 
organisation or pose a risk to the health and safety or the individual freedoms of 
the data subjects. 

Six categories of data media 

198. The  standard  divides  the  different  types  of  data  media  into  6  categories  or 
classes: 

 

 Class P (paper) – Information in original size (paper, x-ray films); 

 Class F (microfilm) – Information in reduced format (microfilm); 

 Class O (optical) - Optical data media (CD, DVD, Blu-Ray); 

 Class T (tape) - Magnetic data media (tapes, floppy disks, credit cards); 

 Class H (hard drive) - Magnetic hard drives; 

 

 

 

 

 

 Class E (electronic) - Electronic data media (USB key, SSD, memory cards, smart 
cards,  flash  memory  for  smartphones  and  tablets,  memory  cards  for  digital 
cameras). 
 

Seven levels of security 

199. The seven security levels are derived from the three protection classes, each of 
the classes covering three security levels: 

 Protection class 1 - Security levels 1, 2 and 3 

 Protection class 2 - Security levels 3, 4 and 5 

 Protection class 3 - Security levels 5, 6 and 7

42 

 

200. These security levels determine the amount of effort and resources that will be 
required  to  recover  data  from  destroyed  media  (the  higher  the  security  level,  the 
smaller the debris must be): 

 Security  level  1  -  Data  recovery  requires  a  simple  effort  (concerns  general 

documents to be made illegible). 
 
In other words, level 1 is selected for ordinary data, for which little or no protection 
is  necessary  (for  example  brochures  and  newspapers)  and  whose  possible 
reconstitution from the destroyed medium would not present any data protection 
problem; 
 

 Security  level  2  -  Data  recovery  requires  special  effort  and  tools  (concerns 

internal documents to be made illegible); 
 

 Security  level  3  -  Data  recovery  requires  a  considerable  effort  in  terms  of 
manpower,  time  and  tools  (concerns  sensitive/confidential  data  as  well  as 
personal data subject to high protection requirements); 
 

 Security  level  4  -  Data  recovery  requires  exceptional  effort  and  uncommon 
tools (concerns highly sensitive/confidential data as well as personal data subject 
to high protection requirements); 
 

 Security level 5 - Data recovery possible only with uncommon tools (concerns 
confidential  data  of  fundamental  importance  for  an  organisation  or  the  data 
subjects); 
 

 Security level 6 - Data recovery is unlikely with the current state of technology 

(concerns confidential data subject to extraordinary protection requirements); 
 

 Security  level  7  -  Data  recovery  is  impossible  with  the  current  state  of 
technology (concerns strictly confidential data subject to the highest protection 
requirements). 
 
In other words, level 7 is selected for 'top-secret' data (secret services, military 
documents), when the possibility of reconstructing the data from the destroyed 
medium  must  be  absolutely  ruled  out  (according  to  the  current  state  of 
knowledge). 
 

Tables 

201. We can group all of these elements together in a table to find the necessary level 
of destruction. 

 

 

Information media erasure and destruction guide | Version 1.01 - 23/03/2021  

43 

43 

 

202. For example, here are the recommended security levels for media categories H 
and P: 

 

203. Note:  at  level H1, the  disk  may  be  out  of  service  for  mechanical  or  electronic 
reasons. 

Examples of interpretation 

204. Many manufacturers and resellers add references such as “E-1 / H-3” or “T-1 / E-
2  /  H-3” to  the  description  of  their  media  destruction  devices.  According  to  the 
manufacturers, these are the security levels as per the media class of the DIN 66399 
standard which the equipment can achieve. Here are some examples of how these 
security levels are interpreted: 

 A hard drive falling under media category “H” (see table above) and containing 
sensitive  or  confidential  data  requiring  security  level  3  (i.e.  level  H-3)  must  be 
deformed to meet the requirements of the DIN 66399 standard. 
 

 If a destruction device indicates that it has reached level P-5 (see table above), 
this  means  that  it  meets  security  level  5  for  media  in  the  original  format  (e.g.: 
paper - “P” category of data media) and that it is therefore capable of shredding 
the  medium  into  particles  of  30  mm2.  Such  a  device  will  therefore  meet  the 
requirements  of  the  DIN  standard  for  highly  confidential  data  (for  example 
medical documents). Once destroyed by this device, these data can no longer be 
reconstructed using usual techniques. 
 

 A microfilm belonging to the “F” category of media (table not provided above), 
which  is  highly  confidential  and  which  requires  a  security  level  5  (i.e.  level  F-5) 
must be shredded to a particle size of up to 1 mm². 
 

Use of the DIN standard in practice 

205. Steps to determine the security level to be reached and the maximum size of the 
residue after destruction of the medium in order to select the appropriate destruction 
device: 

A. Among the 3 protection classes, choose the one corresponding to the level of 
confidentiality/security  of  the  data  contained  on  the  media  to  be  destroyed 
(internal document, confidential or highly confidential) 
 

Information media erasure and destruction guide | Version 1.01 - 23/03/2021  

44 

44 

 

B. The selected protection class then offers you a choice among 3 security levels 
(the higher the selected security level, the smaller the residue). 
 
C. Then select the type of medium to be destroyed (paper, electronic, magnetic 
tapes, etc.) 
 
D. Now connect the data medium and the security level. You can then use this 
information to select an appropriate document shredder. 
 

DIN and ISO 

206. In 2018, ISO/IEC JTC101 standardised at the international level the DIN 66399 
standard,  developed  in  2013.  Numbered  ISO/IEC  21964,  this  standard  is  now 
referenced by organisations around the world for data destruction requirements. The 
materials referenced in the security levels are identical to those referenced in the DIN 
66399 standard. 

 

207. The 3 parts of the DIN standard (see par.194) correspond to the following 3 parts 
of the ISO standard: 

 ISO/IEC 21964-1:2018 - Information technology — Destruction of data carriers 

— Part 1: Principles and definitions 
 

 ISO/IEC 21964-2:2018 - Information technology — Destruction of data carriers 

— Part 2: Requirements for equipment for destruction of data carriers 
 

 ISO/IEC 21964-3:2018 - Information technology — Destruction of data carriers 

— Part 3: Process of destruction of data carriers 
 

DIN - NSA - NIST comparison 

208. In  general, the DIN 66399 standard is not as demanding as the NIST or NSA 
guidelines and standards. 
 
209. Thus, contrary to the DIN standard, the NSA recommends that the destruction 
of  hard  disks  (magnetic  and  electronic)  be  preceded  by  degaussing.  In  addition, 
destruction must be done with devices approved by the NSA. 
 
210. Furthermore,  degaussing, 
in 
fragmentation of the medium, is not taken into account by the DIN standard, whereas 
the  NSA  on  the  one  hand,  integrates  it  and  recommends  that  it  be  followed  by  a 
deformation or destruction technique and the NIST on the other hand, integrates it at 
the purge level (and indirectly at the destroy level, given the irreparable damage that 
the technique can cause). 
 
211. With regard to the security levels themselves, the NIST requires, for example for 
paper media, shredding that produces residues of no more than 1mm x 5mm per side, 

like  any  technique  that  does  not  result

or spraying/disintegration using a device fitted with a 2.4 mm safety screen102. Only 
the latest DIN security level (P-7) meets this requirement (maximum residue size of 5 
mm2). 
 
212. Another peculiarity, associated with each security level of the DIN standard and 
absent from the NIST and  NSA guidelines and standards, also reduces the level of 
requirement. It is the permissible deviation or discrepancy from the recommended 
particle size for each security level of the DIN standard. 
 
213. For  example,  the  security  level  H5  (see  table  par.202)  of  the  DIN  standard, 
specifies a maximum residue size of 320 mm2, but the full specifications of this level 
actually state that only 90% of these particles must be less than or equal to this size 
and allows 10% of them to reach 800 mm². This in itself would tend to disqualify H5 
as acceptable for confidential data of fundamental importance to an organisation or 
the data subject. 
 
214. This  permissible  deviation  is  defined  at  each  security  level  for  each  type  of 
medium. 
 
215. In summary, the DIN 66399 standard is easy to read and useful to the business 
world but is arguably less suitable for media containing highly confidential data and 
requiring a high level of security, than the NIST and NSA guidelines and standards. 

 

 

 

102 The medium is cut continuously until the resulting particles are small enough to pass through a sieve 
of specific size.

4. Special cases 

216. It is not  always  possible  for  the  controller  to erase  or  destroy  the  information 
media. 
 
217. This is the case when the media are not owned by it. For example, IT equipment 
under rental contract (printers/photocopiers, server infrastructure at the IT service 
provider’s  premises,  cloud  computing  or  even  video  surveillance  system  with 
recording). 
 
218. The controller must thus ensure that the contract provides for the possibility of 
erasing the data or destroying the media according to a method that is acceptable to 
it  and  whose  proper  execution  and  result  it  will  be  able  to  verify.  If  contractual 
adaptation or control prove to be difficult, the controller can also negotiate a purchase 
of the media contained in the devices.  
 
219. We cannot overemphasise the need to address data protection issues before 
the contract is signed. This often turns out to be difficult afterwards.  
 
220. This is also the case when  a device containing an  information medium (or the 
medium  itself)  must  be  repaired,  replaced  or  undergo  maintenance  outside  your 
scope of control. You must then assess the risk associated with access to the data by 
the service provider. It should be reiterated that the GDPR focuses on the impact of a 
loss of confidentiality for the data subjects (the people to whom the data relate). 
 
221. If  this operation presents a risk  to the data subjects, it must remain under the 
control of the controller (e.g. on-site repair or purchase of a replacement medium in 
order to keep the defective one103). 

 

 

 

103  It  should  be  noted  that  some  suppliers  (including  HP,  Dell  and  Lenovo)  offer  the  possibility  of 
subscribing to an additional “keep your drive” guarantee allowing the customer to retain defective media 
which must be replaced.

5. Verification 

222. The last step of the procedure prior to the issuance of a document certifying the 
sanitisation or destruction (see 6th part “Recording”), is to verify the destruction of the 
data, which helps to ensure that they have been properly sanitised or destroyed. It is 
essential because there could be multiple causes of failure. Consider human errors 
(e.g.: unprocessed disk put in the stack of processed disks, lack of training, desire to 
finish  fast),  hardware  errors  (e.g.:  damaged  shredder  knife  or  failure  of  one  of  the 
components located between  the erasure software and the data on the disks) and 
software errors (lack of update, software quality). 
 
223. When the controller calls on a subcontractor for the sanitisation or destruction 
operations, this will require discussing the verification procedures with the latter and 
possibly defining them contractually. 
 
224. The verification is  ideally  performed  by  an  independent  person  who  has  not 
taken part in the actual destruction or sanitisation of the data media. Following the 
same logic, when software is used for data sanitisation, the verification part should be 
performed by software different from that used for sanitisation. 
 
225. This quality control process is documented in the same way as the other steps 
of the destruction/sanitisation procedure. For example, the number of samples to be 
tested will be provided for in the documentation. 
 
226. In  addition  to  this  documentation,  the  controller  must  have  an  information 
system  that  allows,  on  request,  to  produce  proof  of  compliance  (i.e.  confirm  the 
successful erasure of data), medium by medium. 
 
227. We will end this 5th part with some verification information specific to different 
‘sanitisation’ techniques. 

Erasure - overwriting 

228. Depending  on  its extent,  the  result  of  the  verification  may  be  more  or  less 
reliable, the best assurance of an effective ‘sanitisation’ of the data being generally 
obtained by a complete reading of all the accessible areas of the medium, in order to 
ensure  that  they  comprise  the  expected  values  (binary  numbers  0  or  1),  i.e.  those 
decided in the configuration of the overwrite pass.  
 
229. This verification reading is obviously possible when the media is not destroyed. 
 
230. Even though the verification is a time-consuming process, the percentage of the 
medium surface to be verified should, depending on the time available, be as large as 
possible,  and  in  any  case  should  not  be  less  than  10%  (which  is  also  often  the 
percentage offered by default by third-party software). 

231. Third-party software and integrated commands provide verification capabilities. 
However, if you wish to carry out a manual and independent verification of the tool 
used for sanitisation, a disk editor (often combined with  a hex editor) can  be used. 
These software are also most often used for data recovery and digital forensics. \\ For 
example, we will cite three of these software: Active@ Disk Editor and HxD (freeware) 
as well as WinHex (well-known commercial software). 

 

Information media erasure and destruction guide | Version 1.01 - 23/03/2021  

48 

48 

 

 
232. For  the  clear  and  purge  levels,  either  with  third-party  software  or  when  an 
integrated  overwrite  command  is used,  the  verification  shall  confirm  that  the 
expected values (see par.228) are present on the medium. In case several overwrite 
passes have been applied, the values of the last pass will be considered. 

Cryptographic erasure 

233. In the case of cryptographic erasure, the most effective verification will be to 
read  random  locations  before  erasure,  and  again  after  cryptographic  erasure  to 
compare the results. 
 
234. This means that if the cryptographic erasure is followed by another technique 
(e.g. destruction), the verification must be carried out before the latter. Verification via 
rapid sampling will also be performed after the additional technique is performed. 

Shredding, crushing, disintegration 

235. For  media  that  have  been  reduced  to  pieces,  a  verification  of  the  size  of  the 
residues will be carried out visually or using a sieve corresponding to the maximum 
accepted size or another measuring instrument (e.g. high-precision digital caliper). 

Degaussing 

236. Ensuring  proper  degaussing depends  primarily  on  selecting  an  effective 
degausser, using it properly, and periodically carrying out verification of the results to 
ensure it is working as intended.

6. Recording 

237. Proof of destruction is an essential part of the traceability chain. In accordance 
with the principle of accountability of the GDPR (Article 5.2), it will allow the controller 
to  demonstrate  compliance  with  the  principles  applicable  to  the  processing  of 
personal  data,  including  those  relating  to  limitation  of  storage  and  integrity  and 
confidentiality (Art.5.1.e and f - see Appendix B). 
 
238. It is therefore important to record and keep information relating to the proper 
conduct of sanitisation and/or destruction and to the technique (and thus to the level 
of confidentiality/security selected), whether the procedure is carried out internally or 
with the help of a subcontractor. Proof of destruction/sanitisation is generally issued 
by the person in charge of the operation (under the authority of the subcontractor or 
the controller) and validated by a person designated by the controller. 
 
239. Although  this  proof  is often called  ‘certificate’  of  destruction  by  the  various 
players  in  the  sector,  we  prefer  the  terms  attestation  or  declaration,  for  their  less 
official connotation104. 

Subcontracting 

240. When  a  subcontractor  is  called  upon  for  the  sanitisation  and/or  destruction 
of information media, the latter can be collected and retained by the controller in a 
place to which access is not secure, until the subcontractor collects them. Temporary 
storage of these media does not exclude the possibility of loss or theft. Therefore, it 
may be useful to compare the list of media that have been stored and the list of media 
that are actually supported by the external service provider. We would like to remind 
you  of  the  need  to  appoint  one  or  more  managers  for  each  stage  of  processing, 
including those for collecting media and storing them. 
 
241. The actual sanitisation process can be carried out on the controller’s site or off-
site (depending on the technical possibilities at the subcontractor’s disposal or the 
request of the controller). In the case of off-site operations, ideally a representative of 
the  controller  should  be  physically  present  throughout  the  destruction  process,  in 
order to ensure that the media have indeed been destroyed. Without this, the “proof 
of destruction” submitted by the subcontractor might not correspond to reality and 
not  constitute  documentary  evidence.  The  controller  may  also  call  on  bailiffs  to 
control and record all of the operations. 
 
242. As  already  mentioned  in  par.58,  the  issuance  by  the  subcontractor  of  a 
sanitisation/destruction  certificate  must  be  part  of  the  contractual  agreement 
concluded with it. If data which were to be processed under the contract are found 
subsequently,  the  certificate  may  constitute  proof  that  the  subcontractor  has 
committed a fault. 

Certificate 

243. Proof of sanitisation/destruction will be in the form of a detailed certificate for 
each  medium  that  has  been  processed.  Whether  in  paper  or  digital  format,  it  is  a 

 

104  The  Merriam-Webster  defines  a  certificate  as  a  “a  document  containing  a  certified  statement 
especially as to the truth of something”.

critical element that must make it possible to validate that the data has been rendered 
irrecoverable from the medium that has been sanitised. 
 
244. It  generally  lists  each  storage  device  by  serial  number,  describes  the  level  of 
confidentiality/security targeted (clear, purge, destroy, H-1, P-5, etc.), the sanitisation 
technique used (degaussing, shredding, cryptographic erasure, etc.), the tools used to 
achieve this, the verification method used and its result as well as other information, 
for example related to the date, place and persons involved. 
 
245. Concisely, the destruction certificate will include information relating to: 

 The date and place of the procedure; 

 The organisation, the person carrying out the destruction (identification); 

 The data medium and the equipment incorporating this medium (serial number, 

 The 

technique 

hardware 
confidentiality/security, reference standard, method, etc.); 
 

(software 

used 

and 

 The verification (method) and its final result; 

tools, 

level  of 

 The purpose of the medium (reuse, disposal, return to the supplier, etc.); 

 The  validation  of  the  certificate  (contact  details  of  the  person  verifying  the 
certificate,  this  person  being  different  from  the  one  who  carried  out  the 
destruction).  

 
246. The certificate must  be  retained  and  be  produced  on  request.  Although  the 
Belgian Crossroads Bank for Social Security (BCSS) recommends a retention period 
of the certificate “of at least 2 years105”, we consider it prudent to take into account 
the legal limitation periods106. These periods will generally be 5107 or 10 years108. 
 
247. In  fact,  as  long  as  the  limitation  period  has  not  expired,  a  person  or  an 
organisation  having suffered damage  as  a result  of  inadequate  data  sanitisation  or 
insufficient destruction of a data medium, may  apply to the courts and  tribunals in 
order to obtain an order that the controller be ordered to pay compensation for the 
damage or even be subject to other sanctions.

The Clear level must result in at least one write pass with a 
fixed data value (e.g.: all zeros). 
Optional: multiple write passes or more complex values can 
optionally be used. 
In order of preference: 
 1. Sanitize Device command: If supported, use one of the 
commands of the ATA Sanitize Device features (preferable 
to the Secure Erase command). One or both of the following 
options may be available: 
1.a) Overwrite (overwrite ext. command). Apply a write pass 
with  a  fixed  data  value  (e.g.:  all  zeros).  A  single  write  pass 
should suffice to purge the media. 
Optional: instead of one write pass, use three write passes, 
using the invert option so that the second write pass is the 
inverted version of the specified model. 
1.b) Cryptographic erase (crypto scramble ext command). 
Optional: After cryptographic erasure is successfully applied, 
use  the  overwrite  command  to  write  a  series  of  zeros  or  a 
pseudo-random pattern to the media. If this command is not 
supported, the Secure Erase or Clear procedure can also be 
applied after the cryptographic erase. 
 
 2. Secure Erase command: If supported, use the Secure 
Erase Unit command, in enhanced mode. 
 
  3.  Cryptographic  erase  through  the  Opal  security 
subsystem  class  (see  par.132),  if  integrated commands  are 
not available. 
Optional: After cryptographic erasure is successfully applied, 
use  the  overwrite  command  to  write  a  series  of  zeros  or  a

Appendix B: Extracts from the GDPR  
Article 5 : Principles relating to processing of personal data 

1.  Personal data shall be: 

 
a)  processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data 

subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’); 
 

b)  collected  for  specified,  explicit  and  legitimate  purposes  and  not  further 
processed  in  a  manner  that  is  incompatible  with  those  purposes;  further 
processing  for  archiving  purposes  in  the  public  interest,  scientific  or 
historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with 
Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes 
(‘purpose limitation’); 
 

c)  adequate,  relevant  and  limited  to  what  is  necessary  in  relation  to  the 

purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’); 
 

d)  accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must 
be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to 
the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without 
delay (‘accuracy’); 
 

e)  kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than 
is  necessary  for  the  purposes  for  which  the  personal  data  are  processed; 
personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data 
will  be  processed  solely  for  archiving  purposes  in  the  public  interest, 
scientific  or  historical  research  purposes  or  statistical  purposes 
in 
accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate 
technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order 
to  safeguard  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  data  subject  (‘storage 
limitation’); 
 

f)  processed  in  a  manner  that  ensures  appropriate  security  of  the  personal 
data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and 
against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical 
or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’);  

 
2.  The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance 

with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’). 

 
Article 32 : Security of processing 

1.  Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the 
nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying 
likelihood  and  severity  for  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  natural  persons,  the 
controller  and  the  processor  shall  implement  appropriate  technical  and 
organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, 
including inter alia as appropriate: 
 
a)  the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data; 

Information media erasure and destruction guide | Version 1.01 - 23/03/2021

58 

 

 

b)  the  ability  to  ensure  the  ongoing  confidentiality,  integrity,  availability  and 

resilience of processing systems and services; 
 

c)  the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely 

manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; 
 

d)  a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of 
technical  and  organisational  measures  for  ensuring  the  security  of  the 
processing. 
 

2.  In assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken in particular 
of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or 
unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to 
personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.  
 

3.  Adherence to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an 
approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as 
an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out 
in paragraph 1 of this Article. 
 

4.  The controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person 
acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to 
personal  data  does  not  process  them  except  on  instructions  from  the 
controller, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law.  

 

Article 33 : Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority 

1. 

In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay 
and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, 
notify  the  personal  data  breach  to  the  supervisory  authority  competent  in 
accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result 
in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification 
to  the  supervisory  authority 
it  shall  be 
accompanied by reasons for the delay. 
 

is  not  made  within  72  hours, 

2.  The processor shall notify the controller without undue delay after becoming 

aware of a personal data breach. 
 

3.  The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least: 
 

a)  describe the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the 
categories  and  approximate  number  of  data  subjects  concerned  and  the 
categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned; 
 

b)  communicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or 

other contact point where more information can be obtained; 
 

c)  describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach; 

 

Information media erasure and destruction guide | Version 1.01 - 23/03/2021  

59 

59 

 

d)  describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to 
address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to 
mitigate its possible adverse effects. 
 

4.  Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the same 

time, the information may be provided in phases without undue further delay. 
 

5.  The controller shall document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts 
relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken. 
That documentation shall enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance 
with this Article. 

 

 

Article 34 : Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject  

1.  When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and 
freedoms  of  natural  persons,  the  controller  shall  communicate  the  personal 
data breach to the data subject without undue delay. 
 

2.  The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article 
shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach 
and contain at least the information and measures referred to in points (b), (c) 
and (d) of Article 33(3). 
 

3.  The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be 

required if any of the following conditions are met: 

 

a)  the  controller  has  implemented  appropriate  technical  and  organisational 
protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data 
affected  by  the  personal  data  breach,  in  particular  those  that  render  the 
personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, 
such as encryption; 
 

b)  the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high 
risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 is 
no longer likely to materialise; 
 

c)  it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall instead 
be a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects 
are informed in an equally effective manner. 
 

4.  If the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the 
data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the 
personal  data  breach  resulting  in  a  high  risk,  may  require  it  to  do  so  or  may 
decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met.
