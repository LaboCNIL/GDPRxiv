1. Motivation

1. Following the agreement concluded between the parties2, as endorsed by the Court of Markets in its judgment

2020/1351 of February 17, 2021, this interlocutory decision amends the decision as follows

interlocutory no. 01/2021 of January 8, 2021.

2. The DPA changes the language of the proceedings from French to Dutch. It means that

correspondence between the DPA and the parties will in future be in Dutch and that future

Provisional and final decisions of the Litigation Chamber will be rendered in Dutch.

However, a French and English translation of the final decision will be provided to the parties by the

Litigation Chamber.

3. On February 4, 2021, the DPA also made available to the parties the inspection report of the

July 13, 2020 in French language, cleared of English terms. No changes have been made

to the content of the report. This new French version of the inspection report replaces

the previous version ex tunc. This implies that IAB Europe undertakes not to invoke the nullity

of the Inspectorate's report on the language legislation base.

4. The DPA has also provided the parties with an authentic version of the inspection report in the language

Dutch, dated February 11, 2021.

English) in the proceedings before the Litigation Chamber, both in writing and orally. In the case

furthermore not be responsible for any translations of procedural documents submitted by a

party for the benefit of the opposing party.

6. Each party shall bear its own costs relating to the appeal proceedings.

7. Considering the importance of transparency with regard to the decision-making process and

the decisions of the Litigation Chamber, as well as because of the specificity and the public interest

presented by this decision, it will be published on the website of the Autorité de la

Data protection. In view of the previous publicity on this case, the House

Litigation has decided not to delete the direct identification data of the parties and the

persons cited, whether natural or legal.

8. The aforementioned agreement between the parties is attached to this decision and is published on the website

Data Protection Authority Internet.

 

FOR THESE REASONS,

THE LITIGATION CHAMBER

 

Decides, after deliberation, to modify Interlocutory Decision No. 01/2021 of the

January 8, 2021:

-

to conduct the proceedings in Dutch, while allowing the parties to express themselves, both in

their conclusions only during the hearing, in French, Dutch or English;

 

-

not to provide translations of written documents submitted in one of these three languages;

 

-

to issue the final decision in Dutch and simultaneously communicate to the parties a

version in French and in English, versions which will also be made available on the site of

ODA.

 

This interlocutory decision may be appealed to the Court of Markets in a

period of 30 days from its notification (art. 108, § 1 of the law of December 3, 2017 on

creation of the Data Protection Authority) with the Data Protection Authority as
