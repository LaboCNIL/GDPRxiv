Subject: proposed transaction in the "Cookies at Mediahuis" file (websites of

De Standaard, Het Nieuwsblad, Gazet van Antwerpen and Het Belang van Limburg)

 
Dear,

 

In the context of the large number of files awaiting examination by the Chamber

Litigation, which leads to long processing times for all cases, the Chamber

Litigation has decided, pursuant to Article 100, § 1, 4° of the law creating the Authority of

Data Protection ("LCA")3, to submit by this letter a proposal for

transaction in the file referred to under the heading ("transaction proposal").

The transaction proposal falls within a context where two of the ten files related to this

folder (the ten folders called "cookies on press sites") have already led to a

decision on the merits in which the Litigation Division found violations giving rise to

twice led to the imposition of an administrative fine of EUR 50,0004.

 

This transaction proposal is made without any detrimental acknowledgment and does not bind

in any way the Litigation Chamber as to a possible position in the event of refusal

of the transaction proposal. The Litigation Chamber refers in particular in this case

 

Decision 85/2022 of 25 May 2022 of

its powers to ascertain whether or not violations have been committed and, if necessary, to

use of the powers of sanction conferred on it by European law5 and Belgian law6.

 

If the party to whom the settlement proposal is addressed expressly refuses this

proposal, the Litigation Chamber will continue the procedure on the merits and will deal with the case

other than by transaction.

 

a) Procedural status of the settlement proposal and the settlement

The transaction proposal submitted here precedes the deliberation phase relating to the

finding of potential violations in this case. In this sense, the Chamber

Litigation only takes into account, in its settlement proposal, the findings that

were mentioned in the report of the Inspection Service of the Authority for the protection of

data, without verifying the accuracy of these findings.

 

Given that the procedure before the Litigation Chamber of the Data Protection Authority does not

cannot be assimilated to the procedure of criminal law, "the transaction" as provided for by the

Belgian legislator under Article 100, § 1, 4° of the LCA cannot be assimilated to the

"transaction" provided for in criminal law. The transaction within the meaning of the ACL has indeed a characterui

generis.

First of all, the Litigation Chamber does not pronounce hic et nunc on the existence

possible violations, even if the procedure is already in the examination phase "as to the

merits" in accordance with Articles 98 and 99 of the LCA. In this context, the Litigation Division makes

use of the possibility at its disposal and of its explicit competence to formulate a proposal

of transaction, similar to what is also possible in the case of a "transaction" in

criminal matter.

 

In addition, the Litigation Division mentions the precise facts, situating them in time and in

space, following which the transaction proposal intervenes (infra). Although, as stated

above, the Litigation Chamber does not pronounce hic et nunc on the existence of violations, it

must nevertheless be based on the facts presented in the file to formulate the proposal for

transaction. The amount that the Litigation Chamber proposes to the party to pay must indeed

be proportionate to the nature of the possible violations. The settlement proposal therefore bears

on certain facts in a given period and (technical) context, as described in the

 

5 See Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data,
and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), hereinafter "GDPR";

report of the Inspection Service, the facts which do not fall within this period and this context

not covered by the transaction7.

Decision on the merits 154/2022 - 7/9

 

 

b) Finding by the Inspection Department in connection with the transaction proposal

In this case, the findings made by the Inspection Service of the Authority for the Protection of

data that the Litigation Chamber takes into account - without however ruling on the merits -

when proposing the conditions for the transaction are as follows8:

-

"Finding 1: placement of cookies not strictly necessary before the collection of the

consent"9

"Finding 2: pre-ticked boxes for partners"10

"Finding 3: use of third-party cookies without consent"11

"Finding 4: incomplete information"12

"Finding 5: unjustified cookie retention periods"13

"Finding 6: withdrawal of consent not respected"14

c) Substantive conditions

As part of the settlement proposal, the conditions accepted by the party to the procedure

are the following :

- Mediahuis undertakes to pay the sum of EUR 10,000 to the Belgian Treasury, in accordance with the

procedures defined by the Federal Public Service Finance15. Mediahuis waives all

civil and other action related to the transaction, for example, but not limited to, the case of a

any unfavorable communication relating to this transaction;

- The Litigation Chamber does not make any finding of possible violations and

formally closes the procedure with the transaction resulting from this proposal, if

Mediahuis accepts the transaction and respects it;

- The Litigation Chamber does not consider the acceptance of a transaction proposal

as a confession which could in particular be used as an aggravating circumstance when

 

7 In this sense, the ne bis in idem principle does not apply to facts that do not fall within this scope.
8 When taking into account the findings of the Inspection Service, the Litigation Chamber also takes
full consideration of the supplemental investigation report of November 30, 2020 in DOS-2020-03536.
9 Report of the Inspection Service of the Data Protection Authority of 7 October 2020 in the file

law shall be paid or collected for the benefit of the Treasury by the general administration of Collection and Collection."
(proper underlining)

Decision on the merits 154/2022 - 8/9

the establishment of the sanction in future proceedings before the Chamber

Litigation16;

- In the event of explicit acceptance or in the absence of reaction from the party to which the

transaction proposal is sent within the period specified below, this proposal

of transaction will take the form of a formal decision which will be published on the website

Internet of the Data Protection Authority, without omitting the identification data

direct.

If the conditions of the transaction are not respected, the Litigation Chamber reserves the right to

right to cancel the settlement decision and to continue the procedure in this file for another

way, or to end it.

 

d) Deadline

Mediahuis must react within 30 days of receipt of this proposal for

transaction. In the absence of a reaction, the transaction proposal will be considered as

accepted under the conditions set out above.

 

e) Existence of other controllers and/or processors

This transaction proposal is addressed solely to Mediahuis. She doesn't take

position on whether and to what extent other actors are responsible for

potential breaches that gave rise to this Proposed Settlement.

 

f) Validation of the transaction

If the settlement proposal gives rise to a formal decision to settle due to

the explicit acceptance or lack of reaction, within the aforementioned period, of the party to

which the settlement proposal is addressed, an appeal may be lodged by the "party

causing grievance"17.

 

 

 

16 See in particular Article 83, paragraph 2, point e) of the GDPR in the context of the imposition of administrative fines when
of the finding of violations following "any relevant violation previously committed by the person in charge of the
processing or the processor".

17 Under Article 108, § 1 of the LCA, this decision may be appealed to the Court of Markets
(Brussels Court of Appeal) within thirty days of its notification, with the Data Protection Authority
given as a defendant.

This appeal can be introduced by means of a contradictory request which must include the information listed in Article
1034ter of the Judicial Code. The contradictory request must be filed with the registry of the Market Court in accordance with
article 1034quinquies of the Judicial Code, or via the e-Deposit computer system of Justice (article 32ter of the
Judicial Code).

The final transaction does not affect the rights of any individuals (in this case, it is not

of a complaint file) having suffered damage to claim damages before a

civil court on the basis in particular of Article 82 of the GDPR.

Decision on the merits 154/2022 - 9/9

 

 

Please accept, Madam, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.
