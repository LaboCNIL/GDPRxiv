Litigation will first examine whether it is technically possible for it to render a decision

with regard to said complaint. Otherwise, this complaint will necessarily be closed.

not followed up for technical reason1.

the Litigation Chamber, point 3.1.

Decision on the merits 169/2022 - 4/7

15. In support of the arguments which follow and on the basis of the powers conferred on him

granted by the legislator under section 100.1. of the LCA, the Litigation Chamber

decides to close the complaint without further action in accordance with article 100.1., 1° of

the ACL.

16. In matters of dismissal, the Litigation Chamber must justify its decision by

step and:

- to pronounce a classification without technical continuation if the file does not contain or not
enough elements likely to lead to a sanction or if it includes a

technical obstacle preventing him from rendering a decision;

 

- or pronounce a classification without continuation of opportunity, if in spite of the presence of elements
likely to lead to a sanction, the continuation of the examination of the file does not seem to him

timely given its priorities.

17. If the dismissal takes place on the basis of several reasons (respectively technical or

of opportunity),

the reasons for the dismissal must be dealt with in order

important.

18. In the present case, the Litigation Division orders a classification without technical follow-up in

application of Article 100.1., 1° of the LCA on the basis of the reasoning which follows (points 19 to 27).

19. On November 22, 2022, the Litigation Chamber took decision 168/2022 with regard to the

defendant. Pursuant to this decision, the Litigation Chamber adopted, with regard to

facts identical to those denounced by the complainant, one of the measures listed in Article 100.1 of the

LCA mentioned above, i.e. a transaction (article 100.1.4° LCA).

20. Said settlement decision 168/2022 extends “to potential infringements under the law of 13

June 2005 (in force at the time of the findings of the APD Inspection Service in the

file2), as well as potential breaches of the General Data Protection Regulation.

data (GDPR), with regard to cookies and, more generally, the storage and

consent to the placement and further processing of information on the device of

the user as a data subject. The transaction decision relates to the websites

involved and mentioned in the file and concerns the party to which the proposal of

transaction is addressed”3.

 

2 The settlement decision comes in the context of an own-initiative investigation carried out by the Inspection Service on the
problem of data processing via cookies in the Belgian media sector, including those operated by the
defendant.

3 Point 19 of decision 168/2022 of the Litigation Chamber.

Decision on the merits 169/2022 - 5/7

21. This settlement decision 168/2022 is addressed to the same party as the defendant of the

this decision, or to RTBF.

22. The object of the transaction also relates, as just mentioned, to “the offenses

potential GDPR, with regard to cookies and, more generally, the storage and

consent to the placement and further processing of information on the device of

the user as a data subject”. The settlement thus covers the grievances raised

by the complainant under the terms of his complaint as recalled in point 2 above.

23. Finally, Decision 168/2022 specifies that “the transaction relates only to a specific period:

the period from May 25, 2018 to November 11, 2020”4, i.e. the date of submission of the last

IS report in said file.

24. Within the limits of this decision 168/2022, the Litigation Chamber has thus exhausted its referral

as to the facts denounced by the complainant and as to the corresponding grievances. Bedroom

Litigation therefore classifies the plaintiff's complaint for technical reasons without further action, in

the same material and temporal limits.

25. Decision 168/2022 specifies in the same way that “the transaction exhausts the powers of the

Litigation Chamber to take corrective measures in respect of infractions

potential within the limits of the elements and legal provisions described above and in the

transaction proposal, as well as within the period [read the period] referred to above. There

Chambre Litieuse stresses that the transaction does not affect the powers of the courts and

courts nor those of other authorities to examine infringements where appropriate. There

transaction in this case binds only the Litigation Chamber of the Authority of

Belgian data protection”5.

26. As mentioned above, the object of the transaction formalized in the decision

168/2022 is limited to the period from May 25, 2018 to November 20, 2020, the date on which the SI has

closed its findings in the said file, which exceed the date of June 26, 2019 on which the

SI has closed its investigation initiated following the complainant's complaint (point 6).

27. For the period from November 20, 2020 to date, the Litigation Chamber therefore does not have

findings that support the grievances invoked by the complainant. For this reason, the Chamber

Contentious is therefore not in a position to find any breach on the part of

of the defendant and classifies the complaint without follow-up as regards this technical reason also to

support of criterion A.1. of its classification policy note without follow-up6.

 

4 Point 20 of decision 168/2022 of the Litigation Chamber.
5 Point 21 of decision 168/2022 of the Litigation Chamber.
6 In this sense, Decision 168/2022, like the present decision to dismiss, leaves intact the competence of
the DPA to decide for the period after November 20, 2020, if it were to be newly seized of it, on
any shortcomings that would persist to this day with regard to the facts denounced by the complaint.

Decision on the merits 169/2022 - 6/7

28. With regard to the settlement decision (168/2022) for which it opted as

decision to close the present complaint without follow-up, the Litigation Chamber recalls that it

belongs sovereignly as an independent administrative authority - with due respect

relevant articles of the GDPR and the LCA - to determine the corrective measure(s) and

appropriate sanction(s).

29. Thus, it is not for the plaintiff to ask the Litigation Chamber to order

such or such corrective measure or sanction. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Complainant

nevertheless had to ask the Litigation Chamber to pronounce one or the other

measure and/or sanction, it is therefore not for the latter to justify why it does not

would not accept one or the other request made by the complainant. These considerations

leave intact the obligation for the Litigation Chamber to justify the choice of measures and

sanction in which it deems, (among the list of measures and sanctions made available to it by

articles 58 of the GDPR and 95.1 and 100.1 of the ACL) appropriate to condemn the complaining party

cause7. In this case, the Litigation Chamber refers to points 19-27 above concerning

its decision to close the complainant's complaint on a technical ground.

30. In any case, the Litigation Division is not competent to grant

any damages claimed by the plaintiff. This measure is not

not provided for by articles 95 and 100 of the LCA under corrective measures and sanctions

which it is empowered to impose. This prerogative is reserved for the courts and tribunals of the order

judicial.

 

III. Publication of the decision

31. Given the importance of transparency with regard to the decision-making process

and the decisions of the Litigation Chamber, this decision will be published on the website of

the DPA by deleting the direct identification data of the complainant and the

named persons, whether natural or legal, excluding the defendant.

32. The Litigation Chamber judges that the identification of the defendant is necessary since

that this Decision refers to Decision 168/2022 adopted by the Chamber

Litigation against the defendant and whose operative part (transaction) is the basis of this

 

7 Litigation Chamber, Decision on the merits 81/2020. See also the note from the Litigation Chamber relating to the
complainant's position (point D. page 4 in fine). https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/publications/note-relative-a-la-
position-of-the-complainant-in-the-procedure-within-the-litigation-chamber.pdf: “The conclusions of the complainant must
deal with the content of the complaint and not, for example, the nature of the sanction that the Litigation Chamber must impose
according to the complainant. The complainant is of course free to give an opinion on the sanction to be imposed, but the Chamber
Litigation is not obliged to adopt this opinion, nor to refute the arguments of the plaintiff concerning the imposition of the
sanction”.
  

 

Decision on the merits 169/2022 - 7/7

classification decision without technical follow-up. The identity of the defendant having been published

under this decision 168/2022, the omission of the identity of the same defendant in the

terms of

this decision would make no sense. Its explicit mention allows

overwhelmingly the better understanding and coherence of these two decisions of the

Litigation Chamber.

 

FOR THESE REASONS,

the Litigation Chamber of the Data Protection Authority decides, after deliberation:

-

 to close the complaint without further action under article 100.1.1° of the LCA.

 

In accordance with Article 108, § 1 of the LCA, an appeal against this decision may be lodged,

within thirty days of its notification, to the Court of Markets (Court

d'appel de Bruxelles), with

the Data Protection Authority (DPA) as a party

defendant.

Such an appeal may be introduced by means of an interlocutory request which must contain the

information listed in article 1034ter of the Judicial Code8.

The interlocutory request must be filed with the registry of the Market Court in accordance with

article 1034quinquies of C. jud.9, or via the e-Deposit information system of the Ministry of

Justice (article 32ter of the C. jud.).
