COMPARISON:

Publish and/or distribute visible video.

2.) The defendant is guilty of the plaintiff to the attention of the plaintiff's representative

14 days in legal costs of EUR 2,931.00 (cash expenses

reason (identity of the thing).

17.) Even if Art. 77 and Art. 79 GDPR give the impression that a parallel

or successive proceedings before a supervisory authority and a court

seems possible, it cannot be the purpose of the GDPR to first have a court with

the question of the lawfulness of a particular processing of personal data

to deal only with the same question after the completion of the instance of reply

to a supervisory authority (cf. Nemitz in Ehmann/Selmayr2, data protection

Basic Ordinance [2018] Art. 79 margin no. 8).

18.) The complainant has the judicial final settlement

already have an enforceable legal remedy to establish the lawful one

condition (cf. § 1 Z 5 EO).

A successive claim of the data protection authority in the same matter is coming

not to be considered, especially since the complainant's need for legal protection through the

comparison has been fully taken into account. A complaint is therefore no longer

to accept
