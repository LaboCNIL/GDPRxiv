These are the accused (cf. Section 32 (1) VStG), the private prosecutor (cf. Section 56

Para. 2 VStG) and the private party (cf. Section 57 Para. 1 VStG). Furthermore, it follows from

§ 17 VStG a party position of the accused different from the owner of a

Consequently, no inspection of files can be granted.

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.
