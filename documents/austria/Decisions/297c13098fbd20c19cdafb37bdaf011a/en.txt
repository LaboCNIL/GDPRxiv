register with this TAN: XXX". As a result, he asked for the findings and found that

the finding was negative. The following day he received an SMS with the following wording: "You

3. The complainant then replied - according to the parties to the results of the

investigation – in his statement of February 5, 2021 (ha. received on

February 9, 2021) summarized the following:

The ordinance of the Federal Minister for

2. Right to Confidentiality

2.1 Scope of the Right to Confidentiality

According to § 1 Para. 1 DSG, everyone has the right to confidentiality of the data concerning him

personal data, insofar as there is a legitimate interest in it. The existence

such an interest is excluded if data as a result of their lack

Traceability to the person concerned is not accessible to a non-disclosure claim.

The GDPR and in particular the principles enshrined therein are to interpret the

Right to secrecy (cf. the decision of the DSB of October 31, 2018,

GZ DSB-D123.076/0003-DSB/2018).

In the present case, the scope of § 1 Para. 1 DSG is open, since the

information relevant here – namely, that the complainant's PCR test result

is negative - according to Art. 4 Z 1 DSGVO undisputedly refer to this.

2.2 General Restrictions on the Right to Confidentiality

Restrictions on the right to secrecy are then in accordance with Section 1 (2) DSG

permissible if personal data is in the vital interest of the person concerned

are used, the data subject has given his or her consent (or in the terminology of the GDPR:

consent) if there is a qualified legal basis for use

exists, or if the use is due to overriding legitimate interests of a third party

is justified.

2.3 Regarding the negative test as a health date

Before checking the admissibility of the limitation of the right to secrecy is

however, to question whether a negative test - i.e. the finding that a person (up to

at a certain point in time and with a certain probability) not with SARS-CoV-2

is infected - is to be qualified as a health date according to Art. 4 Z 15 DSGVO.

This is relevant because according to § 1 Para. 2 DSG and Art. 9 Para. 1 DSGVO the use of

Data categories that are particularly worthy of protection by their nature, only under strict conditions

conditions is allowed.

In this regard, it should first be noted that the wording of Art. 4 Z 15 GDPR does not apply

a certain (minimum) impairment of physical or mental health

connects, which speaks for a broad interpretation of the term "health date".

This becomes even clearer in recital 35 of the Regulation, according to which personal

Health data should include all data from which information about the previous,

current and future physical or mental health of those affected

emerge person.

These considerations are also covered by the case law of the ECJ, according to which the term

"Health date" is to be interpreted broadly (cf. on the comparable legal situation according to

Guideline 95/46, the judgment of the ECJ of November 6, 2003, C 101/01, Rs Lindqvist, Rz 50 f).

As an intermediate result

therefore

to hold that

(also) the negative test des

Complainant is to be qualified as a health date in accordance with Art. 4 Z 15 GDPR and

the scope of protection of Art. 9 Para. 2 leg. cit. as a benchmark in the following review of

legality must be observed.

2.4 On the Lawfulness of Data Sharing

The data transfer relevant here - i.e. the transmission of the negative test of the

Complainant to a district administrative authority - is not in the vital

The complainant's interest and consent are also not given.

Also on the facts of the legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR

within the scope of Art. 9 Para. 2 leg. cit. cannot be resorted to.

However, the question arises as to whether a qualified legal basis, specifically a

Legal obligation of the Respondent to pass on the data relevant here,

consists.

From a synopsis of the (above) provisions of Article 9(1)(i).

GDPR in conjunction with Section 3 Para. 1 Z 1, Z 1a and Para. 2 EpiG, it follows that the responsible institution

or subsidiary, the responsible laboratory that has identified the causative agent of a notifiable disease

(such as the coronavirus) diagnosed for reporting to the

respectively responsible

District administrative authority (as a health authority) is obliged. To fulfill this

Conversely, as a legal obligation, it is necessary (and therefore permissible) that

the respective body submits an official notification of a positive PCR test.

In the present case, however, an official report about a negative

PCR test submitted.

The obligation to submit an official report about a negative PCR test is

cannot be derived from the wording of § 3 para. 1 no. 1 and no. 1a EpiG.

The obligation to submit an official report specified in Section 3 (1) EpiG can be

Section 1 (2) leg. cit. However, this was then extended by the Federal Minister of Health

be when justified for epidemiological reasons or due

international obligations is required.

This option to expand the reporting requirements was discussed in the current

Pandemic around COVID-19 made use of:

The regulation of the Federal Minister

for health regarding electronic

Laboratory reports in the register of notifiable diseases, Federal Law Gazette II No. 184/2013 as amended,

was amended with an amendment by Federal Law Gazette II No. 323/2020 in such a way that according to

whose § 1 para. 3 facilities are obliged to, in the event of a pandemic with COVID-

19 also all negative and invalid results to the district administrative authority

to transfer.

The ordinance relevant here, with which the reporting obligation was extended, is based on the

legal basis of § 3 para. 1 EpiG and binds the respective medical

facilities alike. In addition, according to ErwGr. 41 first sentence GDPR

Neither is the legal basis based on Article 9(2)(i) GDPR (which is relevant here).

necessarily on a legislative act adopted by a Parliament

based.

Furthermore, there are also no concerns with regard to the determination requirement of

Standard regulations:

Unlike the Wiener contact tracing objected to by the data protection authority

Ordinance (see the decision of November 19, 2020, GZ 2020-0.743.659), are the

Scope and application of Section 3 (1) EpiG in conjunction with Section 1 (3) of the aforementioned ordinance

of the Minister of Health clear and precise and is verbatim for data subjects

of these standards it can be seen that negative and invalid PCR tests are also exempt from reporting

to the district administrative authority (cf. recital 41 second sentence GDPR).

The extension of the obligation to report under Section 3 (1) EpiG is also part of the fight against COVID-19

useful because the data material (i.e. country and federal specific information about

negative and invalid PCR tests) relevant for the orientation of the pandemic strategy -

especially the test strategy – is.

Although this was not objected to by the complainant, it is - in due course

Briefly – it should also be noted that the norms of the EpiG and the cited regulation

of the Minister of Health also requirements with regard to earmarking, data minimization

and data security included.

It is also a PCR test (i.e. the determination of whether a person is infected)

no special data processing operation - such as profiling in accordance with Art. 4 Z 4

GDPR - so that it cannot be assumed that the data set out in Art. 9 (2) lit. i leg. cit.

contain reference to national standards, "reasonable and specific protective measures"

to standardize would be violated.

3. Result

Against the background of all these considerations, the data protection authority therefore comes to this

The result is that the data transfer relevant here is based on the provisions of Section 3 (1) EpiG in conjunction with Section 1 (3)

the statutory obligation of the Minister of Health standardized in the aforementioned regulation

Submit district administrative authority can be supported.

The data transfer relevant here therefore proves to be lawful and is not from anyone

breach of the complainant's right to secrecy.

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.

On the question of whether it was permissible that the relevant district administrative authority in a row

informed about the negative test result via SMS was not to be received, as this was not

more covered by the object of the complaint.
