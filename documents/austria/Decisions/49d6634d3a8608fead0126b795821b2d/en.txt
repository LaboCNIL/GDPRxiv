9. Evidence assessment: These findings are based on the one hand on legal

fixed, and thus generally known facts, on the other hand on the website

the

Respondent

(URL:

https://www.uni***.at/Jobs-

Detail.*41**+M***k**c86e3c6.0.html, accessed May 8, 2020) are still available

job description and a copy of the

e-mail in question, submitted by

Complainant attached to the amended complaint dated March 14, 2019 (PDF,

entrance piece

in GZ: DSB-D124.137/0002-DSB/2019). The statements on

professional activities of the complainant are based on his submissions as well as

the content of the website www.architekt***.de (accessed on May 9, 2020). The facts

of this complaint matter are not disputed between the parties as a whole.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

Total:

10. The complaint has proven to be justified.

applicable legislation:

11. Pursuant to Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. a and c GDPR (heading: "Principles for processing

Personal Data") must process Personal Data lawfully,

in good faith and in a manner that is comprehensible to the person concerned

are processed

(“lawfulness, fair processing,

Transparency") and adequate and relevant to the purpose and to what is necessary for the purposes

be limited to the extent necessary for processing ("data minimization").

12. Pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 GDPR (heading: "Lawfulness of processing") is a

Processing of personal data is lawful only if at least one of the

the following conditions are met: the data subject has given their consent

the processing of the personal data concerning you for one or

given several specific purposes (lit. a); the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a

contract to which the data subject is a party, or for the execution

pre-contractual measures required at the request of the data subject

take place (lit. b); the processing is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation

required to which the person responsible is subject (lit. c); the processing is necessary

to vital interests of the data subject or another natural person

protect person (lit. d); the processing is for the performance of a task

necessary, which is in the public interest or in the exercise of public authority

takes place, which was transferred to the person responsible (lit. e); the processing is to

Protecting the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party

required, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of

data subject who require the protection of personal data prevail,

in particular if the data subject is a child (lit. d).

Lit. f does not apply to that carried out by public authorities in the performance of their duties

Processing.

13. According to § 5 UG 2002, the Respondent has her duties according to § 3 UG 2002

within the framework of the laws and ordinances without instructions and is entitled to

their statutes (these are the regulations provided for in § 19 UG 2002) in the

To give within the framework of the laws in accordance with Art. 81c Para. 1 B-VG itself. The

Bodies of the Respondent are also assigned official tasks (see

in particular § 46 UG 2002).

Respondent’s data protection status:

14. The Respondent

is, as stated, one established by law

Public corporation to which sovereign tasks have been delegated. In the

Appointment to the post of university professor is a matter of a

§§ 98 f UG 2002 and within the framework of university self-government

procedure regulated by the Respondent's statutory statutes. the

The respondent was therefore in the sense of Art. 6 para. 1 last sentence GDPR here as

Authority active in the performance of its tasks, regardless of the question of which

Organs had to decide in individual cases, and whether this in individual cases by decision

or other acts such as the conclusion of contracts.

For this case of complaint it also follows:

15. The use of data processing within the meaning of Art. 4 GDPR

electronic communication system e-mail by the Respondent

in view of the state of the art and in an overall view of the legal

Framework (cf. in particular § 37 Para. 1 ZustG) to be regarded as admissible and can

are based on data protection law on Art. 6 (1) lit. e GDPR, since there is no

legal obligation (Art. 6 para. 1

lit. c GDPR) for the use of this

electronic communication system has existed, but the processing for the

Performance of a task (implementation of the appointment procedure

for the

advertised professorship with applicants from Germany and

abroad) was required, which was in the public interest and in the exercise of public

Violence ensued, which was handed over to those responsible.

16. It follows that no express consent (Article 4 Z 11 GDPR) of

Complainant was required to provide his email address for lawful purposes

of communication and delivery.

17. The Respondent, as the person responsible for the processing, has against the

violate the principle of data minimization in accordance with Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR. From the

established facts and the admission of the Respondent that

Shipping was only "inadvertently" in this way, the conclusion is that

that the Respondent's employee who sent the message

has, the main addressing - as for such cases of sending to a

Address distribution list artfully correct - although made to your own address, it

but from a non-determined and for the result of this procedure also not

has failed to send a total of 56 e-mail addresses of the

distributor in the “Blind Carbon Copy – BCC” field, which allows them to

individual recipients would not have become aware of. Instead, it will be sent

by entering in the "Carbon Copy - CC" field, giving each holder one of the 56th

used e-mail addresses the e-mail addresses of the 55 other recipients

came to knowledge.

18. In the case of the complainant, who is identified by a combination of his (surname) and the

Internet domain of his architect's office existing e-mail address identifiable

was, was determined by the composition of the distribution list in connection with the content of the

Message also disclosed that he had applied for the advertised position.

19. For the purpose of the processing pursued here, there is no reason why not

BCC delivery could have been used as a data-saving method.

The data protection authority assumes that this was a one-time mistake.

20. Contrary to what the Respondent put forward, it does not come down to one

assessment of the complainant's eligibility for protection. It is quite possible

that the data transmitted here is at a different stage of the appeal process

should have been disclosed, for example in connection with a public

Hearing of shortlisted applicants. This changes

but nothing about the fact that the assessed processing operation would not have taken place in this way

may. For assessing the legality of the complaint

processing operation, the question of protection can also be disregarded

remain, since even a reduced worthy of protection in the sense of the purely national

Constitutional provision of § 1 para. 1 DSG by no means a clearly established one

violating the principle of data minimization of Union law

can.

21. The Respondent therefore upholds the Complainant's fundamental right

Confidentiality according to § 1 Abs. 1 DSG violated, and it was therefore the verdict

to make findings (see also the notification of June 24, 2019, GZ DSB-

D124.421/0003-DSB/2019).

22. Finally

is

to note

there

a submission in this regard

Complainant (without express application) to justify his

Complaint is that the assessment of whether the of the

Respondent conducted appeal proceedings was lawful, not in

area of responsibility of the data protection authority.
