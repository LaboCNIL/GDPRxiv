A. Submissions of the parties and course of the proceedings

REASON

1. With the complaint initiating the procedure dated December 30, 2019

led the

Complainant violated the Respondent's right to information

by the Respondent's request for information of November 14

was not fully complied with in 2019. The information provided by the Respondent dated

December 12, 2019 did not have all the documents on the treatment of

Complainant in hospital N*** in 2019. You have according to Art. 15

Para. 3 GDPR the right to receive a copy of the stored data. recital 63

have

here

explicit

health-related data

(patient files, diagnoses,

investigation results

etc.) included. About it

out

asked

the

Appellant to find that the requested by the Respondent

Submission of a copy of your ID, even though it already has a qualified electronic signature

had been submitted was not legal. She also asked for a statement that it

the Respondent had been reasonable, a further additional registration information

to be obtained from MA 62.

2. With a submission dated March 27, 2020, the Respondent commented and led to the

complaint from that

contained in the information of December 12, 2019

personal data are both information about the complainant

relevant processed personal data (Art. 15 Para. 1 DSGVO), as well as a

Copy of the personal data that are the subject of the processing, within the meaning of Art

Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR. The right to information according to Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR only includes that

Right to receive a copy of the data stored about the data subject

personal data, thus a list of these, but this is not a claim to

Transmission of entire files or file copies. Accordingly have the

Complainant has no right under the GDPR to “see all patient files […]

in full as a copy”.

In addition, in the case of the patient's file, there is the possibility of inspecting the

medical history or to have a copy of the medical history made

Reimbursement of costs according to § 17a paragraph 2 lit. g Wr. KAG. The right to information according to Art. 15 GDPR

is also based on the principle lex specialis derogat legi generali of more specific rights

from the area of information but also inspection rights of the Wr. KAG displaced.

The area of hospital law at hand here, namely the perception of

Patients' rights have a European legal basis in Directive 2011/24/EU

(see also Füszl in Aigner/Kletečka/Kletečka-Pulker/Memmer, Handbuch Medizinrecht

(2019) Ch. IV.1.10), which is why another legal act at the same level as the GDPR

have passed. The peculiarity lay only in the fact that the directive as a rule

is not directly applicable but needs to be implemented by national law.

However, this has nothing to do with the equal status of EU regulation and EU directive (or

to the national regulations implementing the EU directive).

Insofar as the complaint (implicitly) related to patient files in analog form,

it should be noted that reference files do not qualify as a file system within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 6 DSGVO

are, which is why the GDPR (and consequently your right to information) are not in this regard

be applicable.

For the requested determination of whether the request for a copy of an ID card was lawful,

stated the respondent, since the complainant required information within the meaning of the GDPR

been granted, only this could be the subject of the complaint and not the modalities.

3. With a submission dated June 30, 2020, the complainant requested the continuation of the

procedure and summarized that she was of the opinion that the provisions of the GDPR

are, as secondary Union law, of a higher rank in the hierarchy of norms than that

Wr. KAG. In addition, she assumes that all files, if these

are not recorded electronically anyway, are structured and based on legal obligations

must be sorted, which means that the GDPR continues to apply to these documents

may be.

4. With a submission of February 2021, the Respondent stated that

the

available in the records

information was archived digitally.

Accordingly, a direct applicability of the GDPR as (partly) automated

given data processing.

5. In its submission of February 16, 2021, the complainant essentially repeated

their previous statements.

B. Subject of Complaint

The subject of the complaint is whether the respondent is the complainant

thereby violated the right to information by not providing complete information about

provided their health-related data.

Furthermore, the requests made by the complainant with regard to the

exercise the right to information.

C. Findings of Facts

6. In the ongoing proceedings before the data protection authority, the respondent submitted on

February 3, 2021 the following information (formatting not reproduced 1:1):

With regard to the information on which the complaint is based, it is reported that the following existing documents were erroneously
were not listed:

-
-

Inpatient letter 0*.**.2019
 *** Outpatient questionnaire 2*.**.2019

 

Evidence assessment: Evidence on the facts that were not in dispute were included

through the submissions of the parties, which are available in the file.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

The following is to be noted at the outset:

The complaint is directed against the "City of Vienna, Department D***", but means

obviously the Viennese health association as the operator of the N*** hospital in the city

Vienna. The Vienna Health Association is a dependent company of the City of Vienna.

The Magistrate (Department D***) represents the City of Vienna in matters relating to the

data protection, in particular before the data protection authority.

It follows from this that the Respondent is the “City of Vienna, represented by the

Municipal Council of the City of Vienna". The blurring of the label of the original

Respondent is not to be blamed on the complainant (cf. also

the decision of the Federal Administrative Court of May 27, 2020, GZ W214 2228346-1 re.

"Viennese living").

Also

is input

to state that it is the objective to

Complainant processed health data according to Art. 4 Z 15 in conjunction with Art. 9

Para. 1 GDPR acts because this data (exclusively) in the context of the medical history

of the complainant are processed (see also the decision of

November 19, 2020, GZ: 2020-0743659).

1. 2. Regarding the question about Directive 2011/24/EU as lex specialis

As data protection information, the complainant requests the (free)

Provision of information that the Respondent has, specifically the content

the medical history.

The Respondent argued that the right to information under Art. 15 GDPR was after the

Principle lex specialis derogat legi generali of more specific rights in the area of

Information but also right of inspection of the Wr. KAG been supplanted, which one

chargeable

for the patient records

foresee. The

present area of

Hospital law, namely the perception of patients' rights, has one

European legal basis in Directive 2011/24/EU.

This objection does not work because according to Art. 2 lit. c of this directive

Directive 95/46/EG remains unaffected. According to Art. 94 Para. 2 GDPR, references to the

Directive 95/46/EC as references to the GDPR.

For this reason alone it cannot be said that Directive 2011/24/EU

DSGVO superseded according to the principle lex specialis derogat legi generali.

Apart from that, Art. 4 Para. 2 lit. f of Directive 2011/24/EU provides that the

Member State of treatment the right of treated patients to draw up a

written or electronic patient file about the treatment as well as - according to the and

subject to national measures implementing Union rules on protection

personal data, in particular the directives 95/46/EG and 2002/58/EG

access to at least one copy of this file.

Also according to this provision, which expressly regulates access to patient files

the requirements of the GDPR are significant.

Directive 2011/24/EU was amended by LGBl. No. 33/2014 in Section 17a (2) lit

Wr. CISA implemented.

Art. 15 GDPR does not recognize any provision equivalent to Section 26 (6) DSG 2000, according to which

the request for information under data protection law is only subsidiary to other rights of inspection

can be exercised. Rather, there is a fundamental right to information in accordance with

Art. 15 GDPR, insofar as there is no permissible restriction under Art. 23 GDPR. Is applicable

On the other hand, a more specific substantive regulation under Union law is governed by the

Principle lex specialis derogat legis generalis. The GDPR cannot do that

be interpreted as conclusively regulating the rights of those affected. Rather regulates the

GDPR, according to its scope, the rights of data subjects in general

way, although it is not excluded that more specific ones can be found in other legal acts of the Union

Provisions are made for the rights of those affected (cf. the decision of June 21

2018, GZ: DSB-D122.844/0006-DSB/2018).

Since in the present case Section 17a (2) lit. g Wr. KAG (which in implementation of the guideline

2011/24/EU was issued) no special right to information (in relation to

GDPR) standardized without reimbursement of costs, can thereby also invoke the right to general

data protection information about your own data are not restricted. On the contrary, the

The aforementioned directive refers – as explained – to Directive 95/46/EC (now GDPR),

which is decisive for the processing of personal data.

It follows from all of the above that Section 17a (2) lit. g Wr. KAG does not derogate from Art. 15 GDPR.

2. Re points 1 and 2

a) Basic information on Art. 15 GDPR

According to Art. 15 Para. 1 GDPR, the person concerned has the right from the person responsible

to request confirmation as to whether personal data concerning you

are processed and, if this is the case, information about this personal data

to receive data and to be entitled to the information pursuant to lit. a to h leg. cit. According to

Art. 15 para. 3 GDPR, the person responsible has a copy of the personal data that

The subject of the processing is to be made available to the data subject. Provides the

affected person submits the application electronically, the information is in a common format

electronic format, unless otherwise specified.

In principle, the Respondent has the personal data processed by her

to disclose the complainant's data, unless there are other exceptions to the

There is a right to information.

b.) Right to a copy (Article 15 (3) GDPR)

The right to a data copy according to Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR exists independently in addition to the

Right to information about the content of the processed data in accordance with paragraph 1 leg. cit. (see.

Franck in Gola [ed.], General Data Protection Regulation2 Art 15 Rz 27).

The complainant believes that information about the contents of the

Patient files, or information about diagnoses, examination results, findings of the

treating physicians and information on treatments or interventions, so essentially

receive a copy of the medical history, about the assertion of the right of access

to be able to

The data protection authority, with reference to the recital 63 and the judgment of the ECJ of

17 July 2014, YS and others, C-141/12 and C-372/12, already stated that Art. 15

Para. 3 GDPR no right to a copy of documents that

contain personal data of an information seeker. under appeal

According to Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR, it is therefore not possible to authorize the issuance of entire documents

request, personal data of an information seeker may also appear in it

(cf. in this sense also the judgment of the Vienna Commercial Court of October 7, 2019,

GZ 18 C 263/19m regarding the issuance of an insurance policy). Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR

only standardizes the right to obtain a “copy of the personal data that

are the subject of the processing" (see also the notification of August 10, 2020,

GZ: 2020-0.204.456 mwN).

Contrary to the complainant's view, recital 63 not derive,

that there is a right to the (free) publication of entire documents: there is namely

of “data in their medical records that contains information such as diagnoses,

Examination results, findings of the attending physicians and information on treatments

or interventions" and not "data from patient files".

From all this it can be deduced that there is no right to copies of the entire patient file after the

GDPR exists, but by means of a request for information, the information of the

recital 63 2nd sentence GDPR can be requested in the patient files.

The entire information provided by the Respondent contained, apart from the names of

Files/findings and therapies with date, at least no complete information on the

health-related data of the complainant

in the patient records, like

for example diagnoses, examination results, findings of the attending physicians.

In view of the above, it is therefore not important to

to reproduce documents and make them available free of charge; Article 15 GDPR

nevertheless guarantees to receive information about this data, be it in the form of a copy

(facsimile) or be it in the form of a description of the content or context in which

personal data are processed.

In any case, the information must be provided precisely in such a way that the person concerned can, on the basis of this

Information assert their rights to deletion, correction and, if necessary, objection

(cf. also on Directive 95/46/EC the judgment of the ECJ of May 7, 2009, C-553/07,

margin nos. 49 and 51).

As a result, the Respondent has in any case inadequately responded to the application

information and she was to be instructed to give the complainant a

DSGVO corresponding, complete information and the health-related

Data in the patient files iSd. recital 63 2nd sentence GDPR to the complainant

provide information.

Point 2 is based on Article 58 (2) (c) GDPR. The restriction according to § 24

Para. 5 DSG must be disregarded because it is not covered by Art. 58 GDPR

(cf. BVwG of May 28, 2020, GZ W211 221 6385-1).

Therefore, the decision had to be made accordingly.

Regarding point 3 and 4:

The complainant lodged a complaint because of insufficient information and not because of

Failure to provide information.

The aim of the complaints procedure based on Art. 15 GDPR is to obtain information about the

processing of personal data by the respondent.

With regard to the applicant's request for a declaration that the

Respondent requested a copy of ID, although it was already a qualified electronic one

Signature was presented, not
