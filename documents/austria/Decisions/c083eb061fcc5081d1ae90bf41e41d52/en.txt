the "regular customer" query for cashless payments and the

customer loyalty program exists and whether there are group-wide links.

In particular, it seems unclear which data from the Respondent at this

in technical terms and transmitted the processor agreement between

the operator of the card terminal and the respondent. Summarized

the Respondent stated again that no processing

also subsequently brought to the attention of the complainant.

B. Subject of Complaint

The subject of the complaint is the question of whether the Respondent

Query of the "company bit" as part of the regular customer query for cashless payment

violated the complainant's right to secrecy. Furthermore

The question arises whether the complainant due to an insufficient

Privacy policy related to the "regular customer query" at the payment terminal in

his right to information according to Art. 13 GDPR has been violated.

C. Findings of Facts

The Respondent is a retail company

branches throughout Austria. The Respondent operates in the course of this activity

Customer loyalty program that customers present one of the

Customer card to be issued by the Respondent, discounts and other advantages

granted. At the customer's request, the ATM card can be used as a customer card

will.

If the debit card is used as a customer card, the "company bit" on the

Customer's ATM card activated.

The file "EF_RFU2" is located on the ATM cards issued in Austria,

consisting of 196 bytes. It contains the regular customer number, the dealer bitmap

and the dealer data. Of these, 8 bytes are used for the regular customer number, 8 bytes for

the bitmap for company bits, and 180 bytes for the dealer data.

The "EF_RFU2" file is neither freely readable nor freely writable.

The "EF_RFU2" file and the bitmap appear as follows:

[Note: The graphic files originally reproduced here
(Screenshots) with a tabular representation of the files in question can be found in the
RIS are not shown.]

A byte consists of 8 bits (note: one bit corresponds to one character). bytes 0 to 7

therefore a total of 64 bits, with only bit 1 for using the

Regular customer query is assigned to the Respondent. All other bits

correspond to the value 0 and are not assigned. In the course of the regular customer query at

Bit 1 of the payment terminal is used to determine whether the debit card for the

The Respondent's customer loyalty program was initiated.

If the regular customer function is activated on the ATM card, the

Initialization the bit (bit 1 of the bitmap) set to 1 and the part of the cash register

transmitted data is written to the card. This initialization takes place

only if the cardholder actively supports the use of the respective

regular customer program and has agreed to use the ATM card instead

the customer card wishes.

In the course of querying regular customers, the cash register can use the terminal

query whether the regular customer function on the cardholder's ATM card

is being used. The terminal then reads the encrypted data from the card

and checks whether the correct company bit is set. After the check has been carried out, this will be sent

As part of the regular customer query, the cash register sends the order record "Stkf-

Query without card return” to the terminal:

[Note: The graphic files originally reproduced here
(Screenshots) with a tabular representation of the process in question can be found in the
RIS are not shown.]

The terminal's response record to the cash register does not contain customer data, but

only the terminal ID, date and time.

Only in the event that the ATM card was initialized as a customer card, the

data written during initialization is returned to the cash desk.

The Complainant participates in the Respondent's customer loyalty program

not part. The "company bit" is not activated on his ATM card (i.e. set to 0).

Evidence assessment: The findings regarding non-participation on

The Respondent's customer loyalty program is based on

consistent submissions of the parties to the proceedings in their letters to the

Data Protection Authority. The findings regarding the technical process of the

not opposed. The complainant's argument that a

Establishing a personal reference may not be convincing either, since this query

says nothing about whether the customer generally participates in the customer loyalty program.

In addition to using the ATM card as a customer card, the Respondent gives

separate customer cards.

In the matter:

The data processing that is the subject of the proceedings relates to the query regarding the

Regular customer status in the course of cashless payment at a retail checkout

Respondent. In this case, an order is sent from the cash desk to the

payment terminal sent. This then reads out whether bit 1 in the file "EF_RFU2"

is enabled or has the value 0. In the present case, the

Complainant does not participate in the customer loyalty program of the Respondent,

which is why no customer card is activated on his ATM card. the

without the addition of further data, there is no information relating to a

identified or identifiable natural person. More data will be

As a result, the complainant - for lack of processing of his

personal data - in the course of the regular customer query with the cashless

nor are violated in his right to information according to Art. 13 DSGVO.

Any processing of personal data in the context of cashless

Since the complaint turns out to be unjustified, it was in accordance with Section 24 (5) DSG

to reject.
