November 2018]

 

II.

The determinations are made on the basis of the following assessment of evidence:

1. The findings regarding the making of the photographs of the two

Affected on October 2, 2018 while posing naked in the women's dressing room

and have found in the shower, results indisputably from the findings of the

Data protection authority in the context of the complaint procedure to DSB-124.273/0003-

DSB/2019 and the existing files. The crime was committed by the accused

admitted in the course of a police investigation. The now confessed submission of

whose responsibility before the investigating authorities and before the data protection authority in

previous complaints procedures. Literally, the accused leads

admitted that the accused wanted to watch the video after it was recorded,

but that wasn't possible because the recording from his cell phone was taken by the

complainants had been deleted."

2. That the accused already in the past, i.e. before October 2, 2018,

during his time as a football coach, several photos

within the

in itself coherent submissions of those affected, which through the evidence of a medical

Examination and bills placed for psychotherapeutic treatments as

will.

 

III.

Legally it follows:

1. Article 83(5)(a) GDPR stipulates that in the event of violations of the provisions of the

Art. 5 and 6 GDPR fines of up to 20,000,000 euros or in the event of a

Company of up to 4% of its total worldwide annual sales

previous financial year may be imposed, depending on which of the

amounts is higher. According to § 22 para. 5 DSG, the responsibility for the imposition of

Fines against natural and legal persons for Austria as a national

supervisory authority at the data protection authority.

2. Regarding the saying: The GDPR defines the term processing in Art. 4 Z 2 GDPR

the enumeration of a number of possible uses. These are included

Collection, recording, organization, ordering, storage, adaptation

or modification, retrieval, retrieval, use, disclosure by

transmission, distribution or any other form of provision, comparison or

association, restriction, deletion or destruction. By making

of the image data that is the subject of the proceedings is the material scope of Art. 2

GDPR opened. The accused's argument that in the – by this

conceded - no data processing can be seen in the creation of the image recordings, since

the recorded data was deleted upon discovery by the two women concerned

have been and thus could never be considered by himself, is capable of

legal qualification

of data processing

Nothing

to

to change. the

Data processing operation was carried out - regardless of which group of people did it

Image material could be viewed later - completed.

3. In any case, the recorded image data constitutes personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 Z

1 GDPR and is also processing due to the storage of the same

iSd Art. 4 Z 2 GDPR given. The accused is responsible for the

to qualify the present data processing within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 7 DSGVO, since this - as above

determined under point I. - his mobile phone using the video recording function

placed in the women's dressing room consciously and of his own accord

obtain nude photographs of the soccer players concerned; so became means and

Purpose of data processing determined by the accused.

4. Art. 5 GDPR sets out the principles for the processing of personal data

and determines its paragraph 1 lit. a that personal data in a lawful manner,

in good faith and in a manner that is comprehensible to the person concerned

must be processed (“lawfulness, fair processing,

Transparency"). The clandestine production of the images in the as stated above

Women's changing room was naturally not foreseeable for those affected and provides

This already constitutes a violation of the principle of Article 5 (1) (a) GDPR.

According to Article 5(1)(b) GDPR, data may only be collected for "legitimate" purposes.

Accordingly, the processing of the data must be legally permissible for the purposes in question

being; ie there must be a relevant legal basis for them and the processing

for these purposes must not violate applicable legal norms. The secret

Taking the nude photos of the two people concerned without their consent is a violation

in any case against the conclusively standardized permissions of Art. 6 Para. 1

GDPR, since consent within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR - as under

Point I. determined - not available, the image processing that is the subject of the proceedings

justifying weighing of interests is not accessible and otherwise none of the

other permissions of Art. 6 Para. 1 GDPR come into play. According to Art.

6 GDPR, processing is only lawful if at least one of the following

conditions are met:

a) The data subject has given their consent to the processing of data relating to them

personal data given for one or more specific purposes;

b) the processing is for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party

Person is required or to carry out pre-contractual measures on request

of the data subject;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation imposed by the

Controller is subject to;

d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject

or to protect another natural person;

e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public domain

interest or in the exercise of official authority, which the person responsible

was transferred;

f) the processing is to protect the legitimate interests of the person responsible or

of a third party required, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms

of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, prevail,

especially when the data subject is a child.

On the lawfulness of processing operations with regard to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR

Recital 47 explains, among other things, that this is done by the legitimate

Interests of a person responsible can be justified, provided that the interests or the

fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail; there they are

reasonable expectations of the data subject based on their relationship with the

those responsible are to be taken into account. In any case, existence is one

legitimate interest to be weighed up particularly carefully, whereby it must also be checked whether a

data subject at the time the personal data was collected and

reasonably foresee, given the circumstances in which it occurs

processing for this purpose may take place. In particular,

when personal data are processed in situations where a data subject

person does not reasonably have to expect further processing

Interests and fundamental rights of the person concerned the interest of the person responsible

predominate. In any case, being secretly filmed in a shower is not a situation

that can reasonably be expected.

5. In addition, the present data processing violates the explicit prohibition of § 12

Para. 4 Z 1 DSG, according to which a picture can be taken without the express consent of

affected person is not permitted in their highly personal area of life. ID

the ErlAB on §§ 12 and 13 in the version of the Data Protection Adaptation Act 2018 (1761

BlgNR 25. GP 8 f) fall under the prohibition of § 12 para. 4 no. 1 DSG in any case

Photographs, with which in the most personal area of life of an affected

Person is intervened and should such interventions only with express

consent may be allowed. Apart from the core area of privacy should therefore

even a disproportionate intervention beforehand may be inadmissible. Undoubtedly

falls under

the

procedural

image recording

inside

the

Women's changing room and shower facility in the prohibited area of § 12 Para. 4 Z 1 DSG, da

Sportswomen regularly dress and undress in this place, use the shower and

legitimately assume that their privacy will be protected.

6. In application of the requirements and obligations under Article 5 Paragraph 1 lit. a and lit. b

in connection with Art. 6 Para. 1 DSGVO and § 12 Para. 4 Z 1 DSG on the present

Facts, the recognizing authority comes to the conclusion that the accused

Under no circumstances should the subject of the proceedings be taken without the consent of the persons concerned

should have carried out.

7. Against the background of the facts established as proven, the accused

as the person responsible according to Art. 4 Z 7 DSGVO therefore the objective factual side of the

administrative violation of Article 83 (5) (a) GDPR.

8. On the part of the accused, the completion of the act with the intention of

(at least) to look at the images that are the subject of the proceedings

and therefore there is fault on the subjective side of the crime in the form of intent within the meaning of

Article 83 (2) (b) GDPR.

 

IV

The following should be noted for sentencing:

1. Pursuant to Art. 83 Para. 1 GDPR, the data protection authority must ensure that the

Imposing fines for violations referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 in each individual case

is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In more detail, paragraph 2 leg cit determines that

the decision to impose a fine and its amount in each

On a case-by-case basis, due consideration should be given to:

a) Nature, severity and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing in question, as well as the number of persons affected by the processing

affected persons and the extent of the damage suffered by them;

b) intentional or negligent breach;

c) any made by the controller or processor

Measures to mitigate the harm caused to data subjects;

d) level of responsibility of the controller or processor below

Taking into account the technical made by them in accordance with Articles 25 and 32

and

organizational measures;

e) any relevant previous breaches by the controller

or the processor;

f) Extent of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach

and mitigate its potential adverse effects;

g) categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) How the violation became known to the supervisory authority, in particular whether

and if necessary

to what extent the person responsible or the

Processor has notified the breach;

i)

j)

[…]

[…]

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstances in the case at hand, such as

financial benefits obtained directly or indirectly as a result of the violation; or

avoided losses.

2. According to Section 19 (1) of the VStG, the bases for assessing the penalty are the

Importance of the criminally protected legal interest and the

intensity of his

impairment by the act. Moreover, according to the purpose of the threat of punishment, the in

Considerable aggravating and mitigating reasons, insofar as they do not already exist

determine the threat of punishment, weigh them against each other. On the extent of the fault

should be given special consideration. Taking into account the nature of

Sections 32 to 35 of the Criminal Code are analogous to administrative penal law

apply. The income and financial circumstances and any duties of care

of the accused must be taken into account when assessing fines; this

however, only to the extent that those not directly applicable are not

Provisions of the GDPR supersede the provisions of the VStG and to the extent

which of Art. 83 para. 8 GDPR and recital 148 with regard to the

ensuring procedural guarantees is ordered.

3. Art. 83 (3) GDPR regulates this in deviation from that set out in Section 22 (2) VStG

Accumulation principle arranged that in cases of equal or related

Processing operations that are intentional or

negligent against several

provisions of the GDPR is violated, the total amount of the fine does not

amount for the most serious violation. Thus, in the scope

of the GDPR - as applied in the present case - the absorption principle

of Art. 83 (3) GDPR.

4. Based on the facts at hand, the following was the sentencing

considered aggravating:

- Secretly taking the nude photos of the two people involved in one

Women's dressing room interferes with the provisions of Art. 8 in an extremely serious manner

EMRK and Art. 7 EuGRC protected legal interests of the private and intimate sphere

both women, one of those affected suffering from mental illness as a result of this intervention

impairments that require psychotherapeutic treatment

moved (Art. 83 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO and § 19 VStG in conjunction with § 32 para. 3 StGB);

- The photographs were taken by the accused for the purpose of

to (at least) look at oneself; the act was thus committed intentionally.

- No significant measures were taken by the accused

to reduce the damage caused to the two affected, rather it is of it

to assume that the generated nude photos from October 2, 2018 - would be these

remained undiscovered - by the accused at least for a certain period of time

would have been saved and viewed. This can also come from the accused

self-admitted behavior from the past are concluded, after which

this in the last few years already several pictures taken within the

made a women's changing room (Article 83 (2) (c) GDPR).

5. The following was taken into account as a mitigating factor in sentencing:

- The accused has participated in administrative penal proceedings before the data protection authority

involved and admitted to having made the recordings, he has thereby to

contributed to finding the truth;

- To date, there have been no complaints against the accused at the data protection authority

relevant criminal record.

6. The actual penalty imposed therefore appears in the light of those established

Income of the accused with regard to the actual value of the crime

measured against the available penalties of Art. 83 Para. 5 GDPR of up to

€ 20,000,000 commensurate with the crime and guilt and its imposition required to the

suspects and third parties from committing the same or similar criminal acts

to hold
