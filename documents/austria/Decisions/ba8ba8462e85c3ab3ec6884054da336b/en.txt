REASON

A. Submissions and Proceedings

On July 27, 2018, the data protection authority was subsequently anonymous

processed e-mail to the automatic photo system of N*** Bergbahnen GmbH

pointed out. The photo system would customers of the summer toboggan run during the ride

take pictures automatically and save the images automatically. You can do these pictures

long these images are stored. You can also use the automatic ones

Do not refuse photo shoots on site.

N*** Bergbahnen GmbH issued a statement dated August 30, 2018

a so-called action cam, which automatically takes a photo of the tobogganing guests on a

previously marked sufficiently clearly and visibly. the

The photograph is made automatically, in which the toboggan guest with the

respective toboggan run through a light barrier. In the entrance area of

Lift system and at the entrance to the summer toboggan run are bilingual signs

set up, which would point to the action cam. Through these signs they would

Tobogganing guests are clearly informed that driving on the

Summer toboggan run and the opportunity to purchase a corresponding one

Actioncam souvenir photos a common and uniform

would constitute the subject matter of the contract. By purchasing the ticket, the

Tobogganing guests have valid (conclusively granted) consent to the image recording. in the

Various signs are posted at clearly visible points along the toboggan run

would point out to the toboggan guest how many meters away the action cam is

be positioned. This means that every toboggan guest has the opportunity to find suitable ones in good time

To take measures to avoid being photographed by the action cam. Also

corresponding souvenir picture is taken during the toboggan run. The duration of

Image storage would be a maximum of 14 hours, the photo data would be every

day at 11:00 p.m.

B. Subject of the proceedings

The subject of the proceedings is the question of whether the tobogganing guests in relation to the image processing

be encouraged to give consent that does not meet the requirements of

GDPR, and the right to secrecy is violated as a result.

Another legal basis was not provided by N*** Bergbahnen GmbH

put forward.

The question of whether the

Image processing for another intervention according to Art. 6 DSGVO or § 12

Para. 2 DSG can be supported.

C. Findings of Facts

The N*** Bergbahnen GmbH operates at the address E***-Weg *7, ***3 N***

summer toboggan run. In the route of the operated summer toboggan run is

a so-called "Actioncam" of the model Aixis P1357-E.

The following information can be found on the N*** Bergbahnen GmbH website

(spelling as in the original):

“Each guest declares himself by purchasing the ticket or walking through the turnstile
agree that the N*** Bergbahnen GmbH during the descent with the
Sommerrodelbahn Action photos of adults and their associated children for
24 hours for later sale to the tobogganists
saves/publishes. A use for any other purpose is
excluded and requires a separate written consent of the
customers."

In the course of the toboggan run, there are various signs that are clearly visible

point out to the toboggan guest how many meters away the action cam is

is positioned. In order not to be recorded by the action cam

for example only the possibilities to cover the face or to the side

rotate. The Actioncam was temporarily installed by N*** Bergbahnen GmbH on August 8th, 2018

taken out of service.

Evidence assessment: The findings made are based on the submissions of the

N*** Bergbahnen GmbH from August 30th, 2018 as well as the information on the homepage

(https://e***berg.n***-info/; last accessed on April 15, 2019).

D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. According to § 12 paragraph 2 DSG, image processing is permitted if the

data subject has consented to the processing of their personal data.

In accordance with Art. 7 GDPR and taking into account Art. 4 Z 11 and Recital 43

GDPR, consent must be given voluntarily and may not be linked to the fulfillment of a

contract, although consent to the performance of this contract is not

is required. Consent is involuntary if, in the event of non-submission of the

consent a disadvantage is to be expected.

The former Art. 29 Data Protection Working Party has dealt with the concept of the

“Consent” and carried out a thorough analysis of the term (cf.

Art. 29 Working Party, Guidance on Consent under Regulation

2016/679, WP 259, rev. 01).

The element "free" implies that the individuals concerned have a real choice and the

have control In general, the GDPR requires that consent is not

is valid when the data subject has no real choice to consent

feels pressured or suffers negative consequences if she does not comply.

When consent is a non-negotiable part of terms and conditions, it will

assumed that the consent was not given voluntarily. Art. 7 para. 4 of the GDPR

points out, among other things, that a situation in which the consent with the

acceptance of contract terms is "bundled" or the performance of a contract

or the provision of a service with a request for consent to a

processing of personal data necessary for the fulfillment of the

contract are not required, is considered to be highly undesirable. Will

consent given in such a situation is deemed not to have been given voluntarily (cf.

Recital 43 GDPR).

When the controller is performing a contract with a request for consent

linked, a data subject who gives the person responsible their

does not wish to make personal data available for processing,

as a result, she runs the risk of being denied services she has asked for.

The controller must demonstrate that it is possible to obtain consent

refuse or revoke without suffering any disadvantages. For example, he has to

demonstrate that refusing or withdrawing consent will not result in costs for

the data subject leads to a clear disadvantage. Furthermore, the

controllers demonstrate that the data subject had a real or free choice,

whether she consents or not (cf. recital 42 GDPR; cf. also the decision of

30 November 2018, GZ DSB-D122.931/0003-DSB/2018).

When coupling the consent to a processing of non-contractual

personal data with the conclusion of a contract is fundamentally of this

to assume that the granting of consent is not voluntary, if not in

Individual case special circumstances for a voluntary data protection

consent (see the judgment of the Supreme Court of August 31, 2018,

GZ 6 Ob 140/18h mwN).

2. Applied to the present case, this means the following:

In this specific case, the ride on the summer toboggan run and the illustration by the

Actioncam according to the specifications of the N*** Bergbahnen GmbH a common and

uniform subject matter of the contract. The consent to take a photo and thus in

processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract and

thus "coupled" to the use of the summer toboggan run, although the consent for the

Fulfillment of the contract - the use of the summer toboggan run for a fee - not

is necessary or required. A real or free choice whether to look from the camera

is included does not exist. If a data subject does not consent to

Recording decreases, so the consequence and the clear disadvantage is that

Not being able to use the summer toboggan run.

The possibility of covering one's face or oneself before passing through the light barrier

Turning to the side doesn't change anything, because even in these cases personal

data are available; In this case, users of the toboggan run can also pay a reasonable fee

Effort can be identified (cf. for a broad interpretation of the term "personal

Date” the judgment of the ECJ of October 19, 2016, C-582/14).

The performance mandate according to point 2 is based on Art. 58 Para. 2 lit. d GDPR,

that according to clause 3 on Art. 58 Para. 2 lit. f GDPR.

A period of eight weeks seems appropriate in order to comply with the performance mandate

to correspond to point 2.

A ban on the current form of data processing is required because it is

is to be classified as unlawful.

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.
