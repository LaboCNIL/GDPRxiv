Complainant has good and regular contact with his parents, which is why the

The transmission of the message in question to Erika A*** in connection with the request

with regard to the complainant's resilience arises solely from concern for the

common son Andreas, since the Respondent was not sure whether it was for her

the complainant's health situation, which sounds dramatic as a layman, is a reliable one

hyperactivity, medication, etc.) is necessary. After between the

The WhatsApp message that is the subject of the proceedings result from what is undisputed in this respect

Submissions of the complainant in his submission initiating the proceedings.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

D.1. For personal reference and the processing of data

In his submission initiating the proceedings, the complainant criticized disclosure

of his health data by the Respondent to a third person. the

Respondent brings

in this context, that on the dated

neither the name nor other personal data of the complainant is visible

be. input

Therefore, the question to be clarified is whether there is any processing at all

personal data of the complainant by the respondent.

According to Art. 4 Z 1 GDPR, "personal data" is all information relating to

relate to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); as

identifiable is a natural person who directly or indirectly, in particular

by association with an identifier such as a name, an identification number

location data, an online identifier or one or more specific

characteristics expressing the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological,

economic, cultural or social identity of this natural person

can be.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has in relation to Art. 2 lit. a of Directive 95/46/EC

already stated that the term "personal data" has a broad meaning

underlying. Accordingly, the term does not refer to sensitive or private information

limited, but potentially includes all types of information both objective and

also of a subjective nature in the form of opinions or assessments, under which

Provided that the information is “about” the person in question.”

(cf. the judgment of the ECJ of December 20, 2017, C-434/16 [Nowak]).

These considerations can be transferred to the current legal situation according to the GDPR

since the definition of "personal data" according to Art. 2 lit

Directive 95/46/EG was taken over in Art. 4 Z 1 DSGVO.

A person is uniquely identified if the identity of the person can be derived directly from the

information itself (cf. in this respect the judgment of the ECJ of October 19, 2016,

C-582/14 [Breyer], para. 38). On the other hand, a person is identifiable if the information is

taken by itself is not sufficient to assign it to a person, but this succeeds as soon as

the information is linked to other information. In other words: will the

data subject, for example, not mentioned by name, but can nevertheless use

If reference data is determined, this is referred to as personal data (cf. Ernst in

Applied to the present case, personal data of the

D.2. General information on the fundamental right to secrecy

The basic right to secrecy enshrined in § 1 DSG, according to its first paragraph

everyone, particularly with regard to respect for their private and family life

is entitled to confidentiality of the personal data concerning him, insofar as

there is a legitimate interest in this, includes the protection of the data subject

However, secrecy is not absolute, but may be breached by certain permissible interventions

be restricted.

It should be noted that in the present case a violation of the right to secrecy

according to § 1 paragraph 1 DSG and limitations of this claim from paragraph 2

leg. cit., but not from Art. 6 Para. 1 (or Art. 9 Para. 2) GDPR.

According to § 1 paragraph 2 DSG restrictions of the right to secrecy are, as far as the

Use of personal data not in the vital interest of the

Affected or with his consent, only to protect overriding legitimate

Interests of another permissible, whereby in the event of intervention by a state authority, this only

may take place on the basis of laws resulting from those mentioned in Art. 8 Para. 2 ECHR

reasons are necessary.

However, the GDPR and in particular the principles anchored in it are

Interpretation of the right to secrecy must be taken into account in any case (cf. the

Notification of July 4, 2019, GZ DSB-D123.652/0001-DSB/2019).

As a preliminary step, it must therefore first be examined whether the facts of the case at hand are dated at all

material scope of application of the GDPR (and subsequently the DSG).

D.3. On the (non-)applicability of the GDPR and the so-called "household exception"

According to Art. 2 Para. 2 lit. c, the GDPR does not apply to the processing

personal data by natural persons to exercise exclusively

personal or family activities (colloquially also known as "household exception"

designated).

The standardization of the "household exemption" represents a weighing decision by the

Union legislator in relation to the right laid down in Article 8 EU-GRC under primary law

Protection of personal data. According to Art. 52 Para. 1 EU-GRC

Restrictions on the rights and freedoms they guarantee must therefore be

as provided by law and the essence of these rights and

respect freedoms.

According to the prevailing view, this exception must therefore be interpreted restrictively (cf. on

largely identical content provision of Art. 3 para. 2 second indent of

Directive 95/46/EC the judgment of the ECJ of 6 November 2003, C-101/01 [Lindqvist]).

The delimitation criterion is the absence of any reference to a professional or

economic activity. I.e. the central criterion

for the applicability of

"Household exception" - and thus for the non-applicability of the GDPR - is the

Attributability of data processing to the private sector (cf. Heissl in Knyrim [ed.],

DatKomm Art. 2 GDPR, para. 70).

It should be noted here that the terms "personal" and "family" refer to the activity

of the individual processing personal data and not the individual whose data

to be processed. (cf. the judgment of the ECJ of July 10, 2018, C-25/17 [Jehovan

todistajat], margin no. 41 mwN.).

In this regard, the GDPR itself mentions, for example, the conduct of correspondence or the

Use of social networks and online activities in the context of a personal or family

Activity (see recital 18 GDPR). However, this only applies to the extent that data is in closed

[Ed.], European

General Data Protection Regulation. Hand commentary, Art. 2, margin no. 13; see also the one cited above

Judgment of the ECJ of July 10, 2018, C-25/17, para. 42 with additional references, according to which an activity is then “not

extends space and thereby to an area outside the private sphere of that person

who processes the data”). The exclusively private use of services such as

WhatsApp will, provided that there is no unrestricted publication of personal

data on the Internet is covered by the scope of the "household exemption" (cf.

Bergauer in Jahnel [ed.], GDPR. Commentary, Art. 2, para. 27).

The term "family" is not to be interpreted strictly in accordance with family law, but encompasses it

regardless of marriage and parentage, also other, from the public opinion as "family"

designated relationships. In this respect, it is irrelevant whether there is a formal bond or not

whether personal relationships exist on a purely informal basis (cf. Ernst in Paal/Pauly

[Ed.], General Data Protection Regulation. Commentary, Art. 2, para. 18).

Based on these considerations, it should therefore be noted in an intermediate step that

that in the present case the exception provision of Art. 2 Para. 2 lit c GDPR

is applicable because the transmission of the WhatsApp message in question to a

individually determined recipient (and not to an indefinite or unlimited

public addressee) on the occasion of a personal and at least indirectly

correspondence between the Respondent and her family

former mother-in-law, which often den

in the sole custody of

Respondent's son cared for, has taken place.

The next step is then to the relationship between the GDPR and the DSG in

with reference to the exceptions mentioned in Art. 2 Para. 2 GDPR.

According to Art. 16 Para. 2 TFEU, there is a Union competence to issue regulations on

the protection of natural persons in the processing of personal data by the

Member States in the exercise of activities falling within the scope of the

fall under Union law.

Insofar as a situation falls within the scope of Art. 8 EU-GRC, have

any constitutional provisions that offer the same guarantee, to the extent

of this agreement to remain "dormant in force" and the assessment is based on this

exclusively according to the provisions of Union law (cf. the recent decision of the

German Federal Constitutional Court of November 6, 2019, GZ 1 BvR 276/17, margin no. 47 ff;

see also VfSlg. 19.632/2012, where the Constitutional Court has already pronounced

has that he is guaranteed in the event of conformity of constitutional law

rights with the EU-GRC using the latter as a control standard).

In the present case it cannot be said that the scope of protection of § 1 DSG over

goes beyond those of Art. 8 EU-GRC, so that § 1 DSG does not apply at all.

But even if one were to see an application of § 1 DSG, it would be

Complaint unsuccessful:

The (simple legal) provision of § 4 Para. 1 DSG explains the GDPR in addition to the DSG

for the fully or partially automated processing of personal data, as well as for

the non-automated processing of personal data stored in a file system

are stored or will be stored,

for applicable without specifically referring to the

Exceptions in Art. 2 Para. 2 GDPR.

In this regard, however, the provisions of the GDPR at national level

fundamentally unrestricted material scope (cf. Kunnert in

Bresich/Dopplinger/Dörnhöfer/Kunnert/Riedl, DSG § 4, note 3), so that due to Art. 2

paragraph 2

lit. c GDPR

from the scope

the GDPR

exempted

Processing operations are also not covered by the DSG (see ErlAB, 1761 BlgNR. XXV

GP, p. 4).

The data protection authority does not overlook the fact that the standardized in Art. 2 Para. 2 lit. c GDPR

"Budget exemption" essentially identical in content to the previous provision of Art. 3

Para. 2 second indent of the guideline 95/46/EG (DS-RL) and according to the

related Rsp. of the ECJ, the Member States were not prevented by this

Scope of national legal provisions, which implement the DS-RL

were enacted to areas not covered by the scope of the DS-RL

to extend, insofar as no other provision of Community law

to the contrary (cf. the already cited judgment of the ECJ of November 6, 2003, C-101/01,

para. 98). The Austrian legislator had of this - created under the DS-RL -

made use of the opportunity and put in place specific data protection regulations for

Processing activities for private or family purposes in the previous provision of the

§ 45 DSG 2000 (cf. original version of Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999). The one just quoted

Provision did not provide for a general exception to the fundamental right to data protection, what

would not have been possible at all due to its simple legal character (cf.

Jahnel, Data Protection Law Manual, p. 433 ff).

With regard to the current legal situation, it should be emphasized that the GDPR itself - due to

the provision of the "household exemption", which was adopted essentially word for word -

does not fall behind the scope of protection of the GDPR, a similar to § 45 DSG 2000

Provision of the Austrian legislature in the DSG, however, no longer (more)

was provided.

From this it can be concluded that the Austrian legislature has extended the scope of protection of the

DSG did not want to extend to facts that are exclusively personal or

relate to family matters.

D.4. Result

On the basis of the above considerations, the determination of Art. 2

Paragraph 2 lit. c GDPR also in connection with an alleged violation of Section 1 Paragraph 1

DSG to apply and is therefore not the scope of the GDPR or the DSG

opened. Consequently, the right of appeal pursuant to Section 24 (1) DSG also stands for the

communication that took place via WhatsApp as part of a personal and

family activities not allowed.

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.
