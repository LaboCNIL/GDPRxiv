2. In its submission of January 29, 2019, the Respondent essentially submitted that

that the notification and summons of the perennial and

previously unobjectionable practice of the Respondent's building and facility authority

3. As part of the granted party hearing, the complainants led in their

Statement of March 11, 2019 summarized from the fact that the publication of

invited neighbors is not considered a violation of § 1 DSG, but as a legal one

Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. e GDPR is invalidated, since the performance of the official task

even if the name is only given and the private residential address is omitted

can be properly perceived.

B. Subject of Complaint

Based on the submissions of the appellants, it follows that

The subject of the complaint, on the one hand, is the question of whether the Respondent

Complainant has violated the fundamental right to secrecy by the

Names of the complainants are linked in such a way that when entering this data

immediately the corresponding pdf document as a search parameter in a search engine

(Claim for construction negotiations) is displayed. On the other hand, the question arises whether the

Respondent informed the complainants by providing their residential addresses in

violated the fundamental right to data protection.

C. Findings of Facts

The complainants, because of their status as neighbors regarding the

Construction project "E*** Gasse 3*, 8*** N***" by the respondent as building authority

received a summons to the relevant building negotiation dated October 18, 2018. The charge

contained not only the names but also the residential addresses of the complainants. the

The Respondent also has the appointment of the construction negotiation in the electronic

Official Journal of the Authority, on the Respondent's website

(https://www.n***gv.at/cms/***/DE), under the heading "Current construction projects and edicts"

provided as a pdf file.

first hit displayed on Google.

In the procedural announcement and summons to the GZ ***-Bau**-

0*2*3*87-***5 are listed under the heading "Neighbors" as follows:

 

[Editor's note: The original at this point as a graphic file
reproduced excerpt from the announcement cannot be made with justifiable effort
be pseudonymised. It consists of a list of 26 neighbors, including one
sequential number, title, first name, surname (or company) and address.]
 

The first complainant is listed under item 13. the second

Complainant is listed under number 12.

Evidence assessment: The findings made are based on the submissions of the

parties and on the content of the file.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

Regarding point 1:

The Respondent is an authority within the meaning of Section 1 (2).

DSG, so that an encroachment on the fundamental right to data protection is only possible on the basis of a

statutory provision into account.

The complainants are indisputably neighbors within the meaning of

Stmk. BauG, so that they had to be invited to the construction negotiations in order to obtain rights if necessary

to be able to claim.

The subjective rights accruing to a neighbor in a building process are in

§ 26 para. 1 and 4 Stmk. BauG listed exhaustively (cf. the knowledge of

Administrative Court of October 6, 2011, Zl. 2011/06/0003).

In the present case, it is not clear to what extent the listing of the residential addresses of the

Complainant (and the other neighbors) to fulfill official tasks -

concretely: arranging and conducting an oral construction negotiation –

is required.

The listing of residential addresses could only serve the purpose of checking whether one

invited person has party status in the construction process. But this is up to the

Building authority or the building contractor (cf. § 25 Para. 1 Z 5 in conjunction with § 22 Para. 2 Z 4

Stmk. BauG), a possible lack of party status of a neighbor can - there

Nothing in this regard on § 26 Stmk. BauG results - from another neighbor not as

subjective public law can be objected to.

Since the listing of the complainants' residential addresses on the summons to

Construction negotiation turns out not to be covered by law, this was a violation of the law

to be determined accordingly.

Regarding point 2:

§ 1 para. 1 DSG stipulates that everyone, especially with regard to respect

of his private and family life, right to secrecy concerning him

Responsible according to Art. 4 Z 7 DSGVO is the natural or legal person

The decisive criterion is therefore the power to decide on the purpose and means of

Processing. The role of the person responsible thus results primarily from the

Fact that a particular body has decided to use personal data for their

The complaint therefore turns out to be unfounded on this point, which is why

was to be decided accordingly.
