Publication of the fact that the communication took place is the

Complainant's right to secrecy and erasure has been violated

and the Respondent also violated his information obligations.

For this reason, the complainant also applied for a procedure according to § 25 para.

1 DSG.

2. The DPA dismissed the complainant's complaint with regard to

a violation of the right to erasure with October 22, 2018, since the

Complainant had not submitted a request for deletion to the Respondent.

Regarding the alleged violation of the right to secrecy and a

Processing based on the performance of a task carried out in the public interest

lies, namely the trust of the population in the Federal Ministry of the Interior

to be maintained, has taken place and the corresponding legal basis can be found in

BMG. At best, § 9 MedienG is also relevant, which also gives authorities the right to

grant counter-notice. The Respondent also does not violate the

he did not have the confidential communication published by the Respondent

publication of his data, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO for

B. Subject of Complaint

Based on the submissions of the appellant, it follows that

The subject of the complaint is whether the respondent by publication

of the procedural text passages on the website against the fundamental right

violated the complainant's confidentiality.

C. Findings of Facts

Based on a published newspaper article, the Respondent criticized that

the appellant did not pay sufficient attention to one during his research

tried to comment.

The complainant then published on October 2, 2019 at 8:08 a.m

D.2. In the matter itself:

The publication of the correspondence on the Respondent's website, as

also the corresponding link on Twitter, constitute processing within the meaning of Art

Art. 4 Z 2 GDPR.

As the Respondent correctly submits, the name and

the email address of the complainant, as well as the fact that

As noted, the complainant posted a passage of text on Twitter, yet

deliberately decided to publish it through his action on Twitter.

With regard to this passage of text, there is therefore no interest worthy of protection

complainant to secrecy according to § 1 DSG and was the complaint

to be dismissed in this regard.

As a further consequence, it must be checked whether the publication of the additional

text passages by the respondent was legally compliant.

As has been established, the complainant has not consented to publication

and this was not done in his vital interest.

The respondent as an auxiliary apparatus of a supreme body is

in any case a "state authority" according to § 1 Para. 2 DSG and the

An encroachment on the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental right of the

Complainant's request for secrecy is therefore only permissible on the basis of the law.

In this regard, the Respondent relies on Part 1 Z 10 of the Annex to § 2 BMG.

This is a provision which, although the scope of the

Federal ministries defined in more detail, but this does not constitute an adequate one

the Respondent cannot justify that the fully comprehensive

Publication was necessary to gain public confidence in the

Respondent to maintain because, as just explained, § 9 MedienG only one

allows for a brief reply. Publication by the Respondent

therefore does not correspond to the requirements of a counter-notification according to § 9 MedienG.

If the Respondent relies on publication due to legitimate

interests according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR, he fails to recognize that according to

Paragraph 1 last sentence leg. cit. does not apply to public authorities in the performance of their duties.

As a result, there was no suitable legal basis for the intervention of the

Respondent in the constitutionally guaranteed basic right of

complainant to secrecy and there is therefore a violation of § 1

DSG before.

The present complaint turned out to be correct with regard to the text passages just discussed

entitled and was therefore in accordance with § 24 para. 5 DSG to give partial compliance and the

assertion of violation.

D.3. Regarding the mandate notice:

As noted, the text passages have since been removed from the website of the

Respondent removed. There is therefore no risk of default. The request of

Appellant was therefore dismissed.
