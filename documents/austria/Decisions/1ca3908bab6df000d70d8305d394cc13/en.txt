Proof of delivery is enclosed with the file.

2. With a statement dated February 13, 2019, the Respondent brought

In summary, the complainant submits his request for information to her

branch in Klagenfurt or the employee present there.

However, the data protection provisions point out at the outset that

that a request for information should be sent in writing to the data protection officer "Ing. Richard

B***, J***gasse *4, 4*3* P***berg, b***@n***.at". the

However, the data protection officer has no corresponding request for information

the complainant may submit his request due to the absence due to vacation

to walter.c***@n***.at [editor's note: last word added, sentence in

Original incomplete due to an editorial error].

B. Subject of Complaint

Based on the submissions of the appellant, it follows that

The subject of the complaint is whether the respondent is the complainant

thereby violated the right to information by responding to his request for information dated

December 10, 2018 did not respond.

C. Findings of Facts

On December 10, 2018, the complainant received a data protection notice by post

Request for information to a branch located in Klagenfurt

Respondent submitted. This request for information became the Respondent

delivered on December 11, 2018. Since the Respondent on that

does not respond to requests for information within a period of one month from delivery

has, the complainant has a relevant complaint to the

introduced data protection authority. The Respondent has until the end of the

proceedings before the data protection authority did not respond to this request for information.

Evidence assessment: The findings made are based on the input of the

Complainant dated January 25, 2019. The Respondent has within the scope of her

Statement of February 13, 2019 confirms that the request for information from

December 10, 2018 was delivered to your branch in Klagenfurt.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

A request for information is a one-sided request that requires receipt

declaration of intent. In order to have legal effects, the request must

have reached the responsible person addressed (cf. for the legal situation

the DSG 2000 the decision of the Data Protection Commission of July 24, 2009,

GZ K121.504/0008-DSK/2009 mwN).

According to Art. 12 Para. 3 GDPR, the person responsible then has within the standard period of

one month from receipt of a request for information to the

Applicant to grant or this pursuant to Art. 12 para. 4 leg. cit. about the relevant

Teach reasons for not taking action.

The European

Regulators, however, open, which is why on the national legislature

must be resorted to. According to the general civil law reception theory is

judging when a statement comes into the recipient's sphere of influence

(cf. § 862a ABGB). According to this reception theory, a declaration is considered to be the addressee

received if they were placed in such a situation that the

acknowledgment by the addressee can be expected under normal circumstances

and any disturbances are only possible in the area of the addressee (cf. Illibauer in

Knyrim [editor], DatKomm Art. 12 GDPR margin no. 85).

In the present case, the request for information was undisputedly sent to a in Klagenfurt

located branch of the Respondent transmitted, whereby the

request for information has undoubtedly reached their sphere of influence. There aren't any

Evidence suggesting the opposite (e.g.,

Request for information, which was obviously sent to a "Noreply" address).

The standard period of one month is therefore calculated from December 11, 2018.

In addition, it should be noted that the person responsible pursuant to Art. 12 para. 2

GDPR must take appropriate measures to ensure that the rights of those affected can be exercised

is facilitated (see also recitals 59 and 63 GDPR).

If the Respondent submits that according to their

Data protection regulations the right to information or the request for information

in writing to the data protection officer "Ing. Richard B***, J***gasse *4, 4*3*

P***berg, b***@n***.at” is to be addressed to her in Art. 12 Para. 2 GDPR

to counter the enshrined facilitation requirement:

A data subject cannot within the framework of data protection regulations or general terms and conditions

are stopped, an application for the exercise of data subject rights - with other

Invalid – delivered to a specific address or in a specific manner

have to. The person concerned only has to ensure that the application

demonstrably entered the sphere of influence of the person responsible. The person in charge has

therefore in accordance with Art. 12 Para. 1 and Para. 2 DSGVO to take appropriate measures that

data protection requests to the appropriate internal office for further processing

Processing can be forwarded so that the standard period according to Art. 3 leg. cit. complied with

can be.

A period of one week is appropriate in view of the time that has already elapsed,

so that the Respondent can provide the relevant information or

Complainant about the reasons for not taking action pursuant to paragraph 4 leg. cit.

can teach.
