3.

In a letter dated May 14, 2020, the person responsible raised - in a timely manner - in accordance with

§ 57 para. 2 AVG Presentation against the mandate decision.

4.

The data protection authority then initiated the investigation. With writing

of May 25, 2020, the Data Protection Authority asked the person responsible to comment

with regard to the data processing under examination and informed that the

Mandate decision - despite timely submission of the presentation - legal effectiveness

informed that, to the extent that this data is still publicly available, the

Data Protection Authority the enforcement authority under the Administrative Enforcement Act

1991 - VVG will request the enforcement of the mandate decision and at the same time the

initiation of administrative penal proceedings against the person responsible.

Rather, these should be presented and discussed transparently in order to

ex officio research by the data protection authority on the Facebook page of the medical association

for Vienna (retrieved on June 29th, 2020), whereby the data protection authority in its official

Research did not find any entries by the person responsible.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

Regarding point 1:

1. On the official examination procedure and mandate decision

The data protection authority initiated on the basis of Article 58 (1) (b) GDPR

ex officio review procedure ("data protection review") against Dr. A*** a.

With the mandate decision of March 30, 2020, to GZ D213.1042 (2020-0.203.677).

Facebook site

https://www.facebook.com/dra*** and on the official Facebook page of the Medical Association

As stated above, this mandate decision was apparently taken as an opportunity

Preliminary proceedings – as also noted – revealed that on the Facebook page

photos/screenshots of medical records are still publicly available.

The subject matter of the presentation procedure in question is the mandate decision

of the data protection authority, whereby the data protection authority confirms the mandate

or change (Hengstschläger/Leeb, General Administrative Procedures Act, § 57,

margin no. 50). While the amendment in every direction, ie in favor of, but also at the expense of

Party can take place, the authority is to be initiated in accordance with § 57 para. 3 AVG

Investigative proceedings are no longer bound to the mandate decision, but are within the meaning of the

§ 39 AVG held to proceed ex officio. This also includes that authority

can include new procedural results in the assessment (cf. the finding of

Administrative Court of January 21, 1997, Zl. 95/11/0396, as well as the decision of the Administrative Court of October 22, 2003,

Zl. 2002/09/0048).

2. On the distribution of roles under data protection law

Determining the distribution of roles under data protection law

is crucial

Meaning,

is determined who

compliance

the

respective

privacy policy is responsible.

According to Art. 4 Z 7 GDPR, that natural or legal person, authority, institution or

another entity responsible for processing, alone or jointly with others

decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data.

Included

the key criterion is the decision component. The role of

Responsible arises primarily from the fact that a specific body

has decided to process personal data for its own purposes. The

"Purpose" describes an expected result, while "means" describes the way

specify how the expected result is to be achieved (cf. Art. 29 Working Party,

Opinion 1/2010 on the concepts of "controller" and

"Contract processor", WP 169, 00264/10/DE, S 15 ff, still with reference to Art. 2 lit. d of

Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC).

dr A*** operates a personal one at https://www.facebook.com/dra*** - as noted

Facebook page, on which, among other things, he also posted the subject matter of the test

published. In his statement, Dr. A*** himself states that he has the data for

published for the purpose of patient safety and to criticize abuses, and

also refers to itself as the “responsible person”. dr A*** is therefore unequivocally as

Responsible according to Art. 4 Z 7 DSGVO for this Facebook page.

3. Processing of personal data, including health data

Personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 1 GDPR is all information that

relate to an identified or identifiable natural person; as identifiable

a natural person, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of attribution

to an identifier such as a name [...] or to one or more special ones

Characteristics expressing the physical […] or social identity of that natural person

are.

According to Art. 4 Z 15 GDPR, "health data" is personal data relating to

the physical or mental health of any natural person, including the

Provision of health services, obtain and from which information about

their state of health.

According to Art. 4 Z 2 GDPR, “processing” means anyone with or without help

process carried out by automated processes or any such series of processes in

connection with personal data such as collecting, capturing, the

organisation, arrangement, storage, adaptation or modification, reading out,

the retrieval, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or any

other form of provision, matching or linking, restriction, the

erasure or annihilation.

In the judgment of November 6, 2003, C-101/01, the ECJ ruled that a

Obtain notifications of incapacity for work, doctor treating you, etc. Even if in

In connection with this data, the name of the patient is not mentioned directly or

is evident, this does not change the qualification as personal data:

With regard to Article 2 lit. a of Directive 95/46/EC, the ECJ has already stated that

The term "personal data" is based on a broad understanding. So he is

Term not limited to sensitive or private information, but includes potentially

all kinds of information of both objective and subjective nature in the form of

Opinions or assessments, provided that they are information

"acts about" the person in question" (cf. the judgment of the ECJ of 20 December

2017, Case Nowak, C-434/16).

Furthermore, in the judgment of 19 October 2016, C-582/14, in margin no. 40 et seq., the ECJ stated that

that

"from the wording of Art. 2 Letter a of Directive 95/46 [now: Art. 4 Z 1 GDPR]
shows that not only a directly identifiable, but also an indirect
identifiable person is considered to be identifiable.

The use of the term "indirect" by the Union legislature indicates that
it is not necessary for the classification of information as personal data,
that the information in itself identifies the individual concerned
allows.

In addition, the 26th recital of Directive 95/46 [now: recital 26 GDPR],
that all means are considered in determining whether a person is identifiable
should be reasonably provided by either the data controller or
could be used by a third party to identify the person concerned.

Since this recital refers to the means that could reasonably be obtained from either
used by the data controller or by a "third party".
could, its wording is an indication that it is necessary for the classification of a date as
"Personal data" within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Directive 95/46 [now:
Art. 4 Z 1 DSGVO] it is not necessary for everyone to identify the person concerned
information required by a single person is in the hands of a single person."

These considerations can be transferred to the current legal situation according to the GDPR

since the definition of "personal data" according to Art. 2 lit

Directive 95/46/EG was taken over in Art. 4 Z1 DSGVO.

Information “about” a specific person is available, among other things, if data relates to the

situation of a person (cf. the opinion of the Art. 29 Working Party on Data Protection

4/2007 on the term "personal data", WP 136, 01248/07/DE, p. 10).

Based on this, it should be noted that the published content is

personal data iSd. Art. 4 Z 1 GDPR. It is – based on the

o.a. case law of the ECJ - it cannot be ruled out that third parties with reasonable effort

can create a personal reference, especially since the data through the publication

become known to an unlimited circle of addressees.

Apart from that, personal data is already processed because partially

the name of the treating/prescribing doctor can be seen and thus his data

be disclosed.

Further go from the published photos/screenshots

information about the

state of health of natural persons, which is why it can also be assumed that

that it is "health data" iSd. Art. 4 Z 15 GDPR (cf. again that

Judgment of November 6, 2003, according to which the term "data on health" within the meaning of Art. 8

Para. 1 of Directive 95/46/EC - now Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR - is to be interpreted broadly, so that

it relates to all information that affects a person's health in all aspects -

physical as well as psychological – concern).

After all, it is clear that the person responsible for personal data, including

Health data, processed by extracting medical documents

published on a website. This even if the name of the person concerned

is not (always) evident.

4. Legal Basis for Processing Special Categories of Personal Data

4.1. For the processing of health data:

In principle, according to Art. 9 Para. 1 DSGVO, the processing of health data is considered

Processing of special categories of personal data (“sensitive data”). The

Processing of this data is prohibited unless the processing is based on a reason specified in paragraph 2

exhaustively enumerated encroachment facts can be supported.

To consider

is therefore whether the data processing under examination is based on one of the

exceptions can be supported.

The person responsible states in summary that data is only available in the type and scope

would be published, such as for tracking events

in the service of

Patient safety is required for authorized persons. Patient safety is for

every therapist/doctor is the main focus of his actions. To protect this

higher-ranking interests of public health care and the administration of justice

sometimes also necessary to criticize and process managers across departments

to inform about grievances. A wide variety of platforms are available for this today

Dispositions such as "CIRS-Medical" and much more to ensure the necessary up-to-date transparency and

To promote communication culture in the medical field (“Just Culture”). Likewise be this

also possible via so-called "social media", of course with protection of the privacy of the

affected patients.

The DPA does not deny that patient safety or patient welfare

represents the most essential focus for physicians.

At the same time, it can be legitimate to point out shortcomings in patient care.

However, as the person responsible explains himself, the privacy of those affected is important

to protect patients.

By publishing photos/screenshots on Facebook, which – as already mentioned

– contain personal health data, but is kept in that same privacy

intervened, which the person responsible claims to want to protect. The submission of

Responsible is thus already in itself contradictory.

The person responsible overlooks

in this context also that one

Weighing of interests in accordance with Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR when processing

health data is not an appropriate legal basis. Other suitable

Legal bases iSd. Art. 9 para. 2 GDPR is not visible to the data protection authority

and were carried out by the person responsible within the scope of his accountability (cf. Art. 5 para. 2

DSGVO) also not put forward. The submitted data protection documentation

(General information, data processing directory, Art. 32 GDPR measures,

processor) and the rest of the opinion of the person responsible are limited

to general statements on the data processing of the person responsible

his work as a doctor.

It is still to be checked whether the publications are subject to the right to freedom of expression

Art. 11 EU-GRC are covered.

The right to freedom of expression conflicts with the right to protection

of personal data according to Art. 8 EU-GRC (cf. the decision of

18 December 2019, GZ DSB-D123.768/0004-DSB/2019 with further references).

In the present case, the Data Protection Authority considers itself competent to treat because

the exception according to § 9 paragraph 1 DSG does not apply (cf. iHa on Facebook postings

again the notification of December 18, 2019 loc.cit.).

As far as health data is concerned, the Supreme Court attaches particular importance to this

and regards them as belonging to the "highly personal sphere of life", which one

Publication regularly excludes (RS0124514) because this is an exposure

equivalent (cf. the decision of December 16, 2008, GZ 11 Os 144/07x mwN).

This is because “sensitive information comes before a non-limitable and controllable

be spread to the public. In such cases, the media indiscretion is already effective

as such compromising and not particularly in need of further adverse impact

be detected.

In the area beyond that, when examining the

Eligibility for exposure in the manner of a mobile system also accompanying circumstances and

to take into account the impact of a release, so a lower degree of

affected privacy by a particularly detrimental form of representation

can be weighed up. Whether this is a case of disregard for private life is determined

thus on the one hand according to the privacy of the facts concerned and on the other hand according to the

Intensity of the intervention in terms of form and content (cf. again the decision

of December 16, 2008).

In the present case, therefore, the interest of the person responsible is in the disclosure

of grievances the interest of the patients affected that their data in this

context will not be published, opposite.

Due to the high need for protection of health data collected by the

Jurisprudence is recognized, it can not be assumed that the interests

of the person responsible predominate in the present case, so that Art. 11 EU-GRC is not considered

Legal basis for the publications in question can be used.

4.2. For the processing of other data:

As stated, in addition to health data, personal data is also collected

iSd Art. 4 Z 1 GDPR, such as the names of those treating you or a medication

prescribing physicians.

This is personal data, but not health data

according to Art. 4 Z 15 GDPR.

The question of whether this data was lawfully published is therefore based on Art. 6

Paragraph 1 GDPR.

As already stated, the person responsible justifies the publications with the fact that it

him to point out grievances in relation to the well-being of the patient or the

patient safety go.

The only legal basis for the publications is therefore Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR

- legitimate interests of the person responsible - into consideration.

According to the case law of the ECJ on Art. 7 lit. f of Directive 95/46/EC (now Art. 6

Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR), processing is permitted under three cumulative conditions:

1. Perception of a legitimate

interest through the

for processing

person responsible or the third party or third parties to whom the data is transmitted,

2. Necessity of processing the personal data to achieve the

legitimate interest and 3. no predominance of the fundamental rights and freedoms of

Data protection data subject about the perceived legitimate interest (cf

most recently the judgment of December 11, 2019, C-708/18).

In the present case, the admissibility of the processing fails at the longest on the third

Prerequisite: It is not apparent to what extent the rights of the

Publication should weigh little for the persons concerned than the right of the

responsible for the processing. In particular, it is not clear to what extent the

Naming specific persons should be useful for the goal pursued by the person responsible,

especially since these people are not accused of any concrete allegations and they are not accused of anything else either

Playing a role in public life (on the role in public life, cf

Decision of December 18, 2019 a.a.O. with further reference to the case law of the OGH).

For this reason, the admissibility of publication based on Art. 11 also fails

EU GRC.

5. Result

The data protection authority therefore comes to the conclusion that the publication of the

content under review without a suitable legal basis – and therefore illegal

is. Since at the time of the decision there were still photos/screenshots of

In this respect, the mandate decision had to be confirmed in accordance with the verdict.

Regarding point 2:
