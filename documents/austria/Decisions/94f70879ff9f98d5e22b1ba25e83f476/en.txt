I) Submissions of the applicant and course of the procedure

REASON

1. With submission of December 16, 2019, received by the data protection authority on

December 19, 2019, the applicant applied for a total of three codes of conduct,

which have been approved by the data protection authority in accordance with Art. 40 Para. 5 GDPR, as

to be accredited. The applicant has as enclosures

to the application or

in the further course of the procedure at the request of the

Documents corresponding to the data protection authority (evidence according to § 2 to 6 ÜStAkk-

V) submitted.

2.

These are the following rules of conduct (in the current version):

A) "Privacy Code of Conduct of Association S*** - S*** CoC", approved with

Notice of November 5, 2019, GZ: DSB-D196.006/0005-DSB/2019

(short

Code of Conduct S***), Holder of the permit: Association S*** (“S***” for short).

B) "Rules of conduct for ****", approved by decision of May 13, 2019, GZ: DSB-

D196.003/0001-DSB/2019 (short: code of conduct M***), holder of the permit:

C) "Privacy Code of Conduct for U***", approved by notice dated August 6th

2019, GZ: DSB-D196.001/0004-DSB/2019 (short: Code of Conduct U***), owner of

Approval: 1st Association T***, 2nd Austrian V*** Association;

3.

The data protection authority requested the applicant with a procedural order dated

January 9, 2020, GZ: DSB-D198.001/0001-DSB/2019, to submit documents

showing that the applicant has been informed by the holders of the permits

regarding the three designated rules of conduct, each with the task of one

monitoring body has been entrusted.

4. By letter dated February 9, 2020, the applicant submitted that such a

Evidence is not provided for either in the ÜStAkk-V or in the GDPR. Moreover be

the relevant rules of conduct, in the absence of a previous designation of one

Monitoring body, only approved suspensively and not yet applicable.

Irrespective of this interpretation of the law, however, the owners of the respective

Permissions requested to provide appropriate confirmations to the data protection authority

to transfer.

5.

The data protection authority then requested all holders of the authorizations for the

Rules of conduct A) to C) with procedural order (request) dated February 19, 2020,

GZ: 2020-0.095.999, for a statement on the following issues:

1.

Do the holders of the permit expressly authorize the applicant to

monitoring station

ordered for the code of conduct and with

her one

corresponding agreement reached?

2.

Speak for or against accreditation of the applicant in the above

sense out?

6.

Of those asked, with letters dated February 10 and April 29, 2020, only

the S*** expressly for accreditation of the applicant as a monitoring body

pronounced for the rules of conduct A). The holders of the permit for the

Rules of conduct C) were expressly stated in the statement of May 12, 2020

against accreditation of the applicant as a monitoring body for

their

rules of conduct stated. the

holder of the permit

for the

have rules of conduct B),

despite repeated requests, none

content

opinion given. However, on August 24, 2020 at the data protection authority

the application by J*** Service GmbH for accreditation as a monitoring body for the

Rules of conduct B) received by both permit holders expressly

is supported in writing and which is currently being examined for procedure number DSB-D198.006

will.

II) Findings of Facts

7.

The submissions under point I), the documents submitted by the applicant and

the declarations of the holders of the rules of conduct A), B) and C) are the

Findings of fact are taken as a basis.

8th.

Evidence assessment: The undisputed facts are based on the under point I)

enumerated process results. The determination that the holders of the

Rules of conduct B) and C) not expressly for or against the accreditation of

Applicant have spoken out for the respective rules of conduct, was also

not disputed by the applicant after being heard by the parties, disputed

was merely the question of the need for a

appropriate consensus.

III) From a legal point of view it follows:

Competence of the Data Protection Authority

9.

The Data Protection Authority is responsible for handling requests for accreditation from

Monitoring bodies within the meaning of Art. 41 Para. 1 DSGVO responsible, which according to Art. 57 Para. 1

lit. q GDPR in conjunction with Section 2 (2) ÜStAkk-V.

Re point 1 (partial accreditation)

10. The activity of the applicant based on the submitted (and the

Factual findings underlying) documents to be made.

11. The applicant has to provide the proof required according to §§ 2 to 6 ÜStAkk-V

satisfaction of the data protection authority.

12. The further justification does not apply according to § 58 para. 2 AVG, because the point of view of

applicant is met.

Regarding point 2 (summary rejection of the remaining parts of the accreditation application)

Interpretation of Art. 41 GDPR

13. Art. 41 GDPR makes no express statement as to whether only a single

Monitoring body – this is what the wording of the first sentence of Article 41 (1) indicates

GDPR (“from a body”; no underlining

in the original; others too

Language versions – such as English, French, Spanish or Italian

- coincide in this regard with the German) - with the monitoring of a

Set of rules may be entrusted, or whether Council and Parliament as legislators of

European Union also a kind of competition between monitoring bodies

wanted to make possible.

14

In the second case, the additional question arises as to whether accreditation of (further)

Surveillance bodies also without consent, and under certain circumstances even against the

the will of the owner of the code of conduct to be monitored (hereinafter

in short: non-consensus accreditation). The latter seems

in terms of

Rules of conduct B) and C) the view of the applicant and accreditation applicant

to be, since in both cases they submitted their application even after the lack of consensus

(rules of conduct B)) or the express objection (rules of conduct C)) of

respective license holder has not restricted accordingly.

15. The European Data Protection Board (short: EDPB) has

in exercise of his

Powers according to Art. 70 Para. 1

lit n) GDPR the guidelines 1/2019

Rules of conduct and monitoring bodies in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

Version 2.0, approved and published on June 4, 2019.

16. In it, the EDPB does not make any clear and

unequivocal view, but shows a clear preference for the possibility

to accredit several monitoring bodies for one set of rules. In particular, in

Margin no. 60 mentions that “at least one monitoring body” should be included in the code of conduct.

(emphasis not in the original) with accreditation from the supervisory authority

have to be.

17. The data protection authority therefore sets Art. 41 GDPR in accordance with the EDPB

so out that an accreditation of several monitoring bodies for one and the same

set of rules is possible (also Strohmaier in Knyrim, DatKomm Art 41 GDPR (as of

1.12.2018, rdb.at), margin no. 17 mwN). However, this is only to be understood that such

Multiple accreditation is not excluded according to the current legal situation.

18. The data protection authority concludes from the logical-systematic context of Art. 40

and 41 GDPR, in particular from Article 40 (4) in conjunction with Article 41 (2) (c) GDPR,

namely further that a monitoring body with the permit holder, the

according to Art. 40 Para. 2 GDPR a representative industry or professional association of

controllers or processors, who must therefore be responsible for its members

– those to be monitored – speaks, has to work together. This only appears then

possible if the associations concerned support the accreditation applicant.

According to the EDPB Guidelines 1/2019 cited above (margin no. 15 f), it is therefore a matter for the

or the permit holder, a monitoring body that appears suitable

select and name. Multiple nominations are permitted.

The decision as to whether multiple accreditation should be possible is therefore up to you

with code of conduct approval holders.

19. As already mentioned, this also speaks in favor of consensual accreditation

Interplay between Art. 40 (4) and Art. 41 (2) lit. c GDPR, since these

Rules of procedure must be coordinated with one another if they cease to have any effect

should.

20. The accreditation of a monitoring body, the permit holder expressly

rejecting it is just as impossible as accreditation

a competing monitoring body if the permit holders already

expressly expresses their support for another accreditation applicant

to have.

21. Such a non-consensual accreditation as the applicant regarding the

rules of conduct B) and C) would lead to the foreseeable future

Permission holders refuse to cooperate in the case described, and the

Surveillance activity for which accreditation has been granted, actually not

can be exercised. Likewise, in this case, an effective interaction of

respective procedural regulations cannot be guaranteed. It can

Union legislators are not, however, assumed to have made a regulation

have, with the

officials that go nowhere and are therefore dysfunctional

permits are to be granted.

For this matter it follows that:

22. The

Applicant, as stated above (margin nos. 1 and 7), those specified in the ÜStAkk-V

Evidence provided.

23. However, as above under margin no. 6 noted, the license holders of the

Rules of conduct C) expressly against accreditation of the applicant

pronounced. However, the approval holders of the code of conduct B) have

their support of the accreditation application to the data protection authority

expressed elsewhere.

24. With regard to both codes of conduct, the preliminary investigation has thus shown that

no basis for the necessary cooperation between the applicant and the

four permit holders concerned. There are no procedures for this

nor structures within the meaning of Article 40 (4) and Article 41 (2) (c) GDPR in order to

to be able to carry out the activity of a monitoring body successfully. the

Accreditation requirements are not met.

25. The application was therefore otherwise dismissed as in point 2).

Regarding point 3 (costs)

26. The cost of the award (administrative fee) is based on the quoted

provisions. The application for approval of a code of conduct is not a submission

according to § 24 DSG and therefore not from the fee and tax exemption clause of the

Section 69 (6) DSG includes.

27. This sum is to be paid into the account of BAWAG P.S.K., Georg-Coch-Platz 2, 1018 Vienna,
