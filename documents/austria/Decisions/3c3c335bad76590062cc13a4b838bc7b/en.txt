The complainant's comments were not received.

B. Subject of Complaint

The subject of the complaint is the question of whether the Respondent

thereby violated the right to information by responding to the request for information from

November 28, 2018 has not ruled, as well as the question of whether the right of access

Duplicate extracts can also be requested.

C. Findings of Facts

The complainant sent a request for information on November 28, 2017 to the

Respondent and requested information about own data, especially about

Transfers from the years back to 2013. The Respondent has none

provides information under data protection law and ties information to costs of EUR 30.00

per year. For the year 2013, the Respondent incurs costs amounting to

EUR 9.92.

 
Evidence Evidence: Evidence was through the submissions of the parties

recorded. The preservation of the matter is undisputed insofar as the parties

consistently described the facts and clarified the relevant facts

The question lies solely in the legal assessment.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. General:

According to the legal situation applicable from May 25, 2018, this was previously according to § 31

DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 83/2013, procedures as

Complaints procedure according to § 24 DSG, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended (cf

Section 69 (4) DSG).

The applicability of the DSG in the current version and the GDPR must be stated,

that according to § 69 DSG there is no statutory transition period and therefore

the legal situation at the time of the official decision is decisive. it's coming

namely, in the present case it does not depend on what happened on a specific date or in a

specific period was legal, since both the DSG 2000 and the DSG it a

Respondents concede, until the end of the official procedure, the information

to catch up (cf. from the stRsp of the VwGH the decision of February 28, 2018,

Zl. Fe 2016/06/0001 with further references). Thus, the complainant's request at the time,

which was based on the then applicable legal situation of § 26 DSG 2000, after which

to assess the now applicable right to information under Art. 15 GDPR and the

compared to ZaDiG 2018.

2. To justify the complaint:

The complaint is justified because the respondent is undisputed

to the data protection request for information not in accordance with the DSG or the

GDPR has reacted in the manner provided for. Already the non-reaction to a

A request for information constitutes a violation of the right to information (cf

Decision of the Data Protection Commission of April 10, 2013, GZ K121.924/0006-

DSK/2013), which is why the complaint had to be upheld.

The complainant also claims that the respondent had him in

Right to information violated by (incomprehensible) costs to the

Information about certain account statements and led to the case law of

Data Protection Commission on GZ: K121.394, according to which the right to information

is to be granted free of charge and only costs actually incurred are prescribed

could become.

The quoted case law of the data protection commission refers to the legal situation

before the GDPR came into force and relates to the content of the rules that are in the current

Can't find legal position.

Applied to the current case, the following must therefore be carried out:

2.1. Regarding the request for information in relation to information obligations:

As data protection information, the complainant requests the (free)

Provision of information held by the Respondent. the

Respondent charges for the objective answer to the information,

does not dispute the existence of a data protection request for information.

The Respondent believes its obligations under the ZaDiG 2018

to have complied, and therefore assumes that the requirements of Art. 12

Paragraph 5 lit. a and b GDPR are present and the complainant abused his right

practice

It should be pointed out that Art. 15 GDPR does not correspond to Section 26 (6) DSG 2000

identical regulation, according to which the data protection request for information

can only be exercised as a subsidiary to other rights of inspection. Rather, there is

fundamental right to information according to Art. 15 DSGVO, insofar as no permissible one

Restriction according to Art. 23 DSGVO exists.

If, on the other hand, a more specific substantive regulation applies under Union law, then this applies

according to the principle lex specialis derogat legis generalis. The GDPR cannot

be interpreted in such a way as to finally regulate the rights of those affected.

Rather, the GDPR, in accordance with its scope of application, regulates the

Data subject rights in a general way, although it is not excluded that in

other legal acts of the Union, more specific regulations on the rights of data subjects

are provided (cf. e.g. Art. 12 et seq. of Directive (EU) 2016/680; Art. 41 of

Regulation (EC) No. 1987/2006 or Art. 37 of Regulation (EC) No. 767/2008).

Since in the present case the ZaDiG 2018 (which implements the Directive (EU)

2015/2366 was issued) no special right to information standardized, can also

the right to general data protection information about your own data

be restricted. On the contrary, the said directive refers to the directive

95/46/EG (Privacy Policy), which governs the processing of personal data

is decisive (Recital 89, Art. 95 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366). Pursuant to Art. 94 para. 2

GDPR, references to the Data Protection Directive shall be deemed to be references to the GDPR.

2.2. Regarding the scope of the data protection information:

In his request for information, the complainant requests the provision of

"Account statements" for the period 2013 - 2018:

“A data subject should have a right of access to data concerning them
personal data that has been collected and have this right
be able to perceive easily and at reasonable intervals in order to become aware of the
to be aware of the processing and to be able to verify its legality […]”
(Recital 63 GDPR)

The complainant is entitled to a free copy of the to be checked

obtain personal data, with the right to obtain a copy of the

may not impair the rights and freedoms of other persons (Art. 15 para. 3 and 4

GDPR).

The complainant can assert the right to information about the him

to check the data processing in question. Since payment receipts are usually far

more than personal data of the data subject, in this case the

complainant, can include the right to information under data protection law only

go so far as that it is for the purpose of verifying the legality of

Data processing corresponds (cf. the judgment of the ECJ of July 17, 2014 in the

joined cases C-141/12 and C-372/12).

The Respondent therefore has the complainant concerning

personal data following the request for information, taking into account the

Restriction of Art. 15 Para. 4 GDPR.

Also the contingency argument that the complainant proceeded in a vexatious way and the

Respondent legitimately makes use of its right under Article 12(5)(a).

GDPR by prescribing costs in the event of excessive requests for information,

cannot be followed.

In its statement, the Respondent refers to a general point

Ban on harassment and explains that the OGH had approved such a thing and that with

Art. 12 (5) lit. a and b GDPR also counteracted vexatious exercise of rights

shall be.

First of all, it must be stated that the Austrian case law requires the existence of a

"General ban on harassment" denied and only an exercise of rights, which

violates good morals in Section 1295 (2) ABGB, is frowned upon (cf

2 Ob 576/55, 3 Ob 520/51 and others, see also OGH in the decision of July 10th

1986, 6 Ob 12/85 = SZ 59/123 = RdW 1986, 306 = JBl 1986, 643).

But what a special claim of the

Respondent (of the person responsible) in accordance with Article 12 (5) lit. a and b GDPR

concerned, it is granted that in the event of manifestly unfounded or

excessive exercise of rights, a right to have costs imposed or a

“Right of Refusal” would apply.

The legislature is bad at it. "particularly in the case of frequent repetition" thereof

that there must be a certain intensity that the person responsible must be able to

would make unreasonable against the fundamentally unfounded subjective right of control

to have to accept (heads in Gantschacher/Jelinek/Schmidl/Spanberger,

Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation1 2017, on Art. 12; see also the

Decision of the DSK from September 14th, 2012, GZ K121.830/0008-DSK/2012).

The complainant exercises the right to information for the first time against the

Respondent and asks for very specific data. Here will too

takes into account that the complainant only requests information about data that he

himself can no longer see the e**banking and therefore the participation of

Respondent is required.

The complainant therefore has no behavior when exercising his right to information

set, which would make it unreasonable for the Respondent to do without

to take action to prescribe costs, or to refuse to provide information.

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.
