1. With a submission dated January 28, 2019, the complainant alleged an infringement

in the right to information in accordance with Art. 13 GDPR and in the right to secrecy.

mail placed. The complainant sent a refusal by e-mail on the same day.

On January 23, 2019, the Respondent contacted a

Advertising for the company's own newsletter including a link to register.

The complainant had no information on data processing

Name and contact details of the person responsible, 2) the contact details of the

Data Protection Officer, 3) the purposes for which the personal data

are to be processed and the legal basis for the processing, 4) the

legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party

restriction of processing or a right to object to processing

a supervisory authority, 8) whether the provision of the personal data is legal

or contractually required or necessary for the conclusion of a contract, whether the

data subject is obliged to provide the personal data, and

what possible consequences the non-provision would have and 8) information about the

intended further processing of the personal data for another

purpose than that for which the personal data was collected.

2. With the completion of February 11, 2019, the respondent was on the part of the

Respondent summed up that the complainant with letters

from April 9, 2019, the information in question in accordance with Section 24 (6) DSG

were subsequently made available.

4. The complainant then replied - according to the parties to the results of the

investigation – in its statements of April 16, 2019 and April 24

2019 summarized that § 24 para. 6 DSG on the situation in which a

responsible person does not comply with the information obligation is not to be applied. sense

and the purpose of Art. 13 GDPR is to provide the data subject with the data collection

The purpose cannot be fulfilled by "catching up" on the information.

Furthermore, the information provided is incomplete and/or incorrect. the

Respondents refer to a "data protection officer", but this is

not designated as a representative within the meaning of Art. 27 GDPR. Under the heading “Collection of

Data" credit reference agencies are mentioned within the scope of the intended purpose, below

these credit agencies are not named as recipients of data (categories),

but it is only said generically that "the data within the

group of companies” are processed and passed on to “business partners”. this

is not precise enough. The Respondent also fulfills the obligation to

Evidence assessment: The findings made are based on the submissions of the

Complainant in the context of the submission of January 28, 2019, which to no

point in time was disputed by the Respondent. In addition, the

findings made on an official search of the website

https://www.alpen***.at/ (accessed August 21, 2019). Finding that it is

the complainant is a registered lawyer, is based on

official knowledge.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. Respondent and its representative in the Union

First of all, it should be pointed out that the "One-Stop-Shop" mechanism according to Art. 60

GDPR does not apply in the present case, since the Respondent, as

results from their statement of April 9, 2019, as the person responsible within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 7

GDPR is to be considered and has its registered office only in Switzerland (cf. the decision of the

Data Protection Authority of March 7, 2019, GZ DSB-D130.033/0003-DSB/2019).

In a statement dated May 8, 2019, the Respondent named R*** Hotels

GmbH as its representative in the Union area in accordance with Art. 3 Para. 3 in conjunction with Art. 27 Para. 1

GDPR. Since the appointment of a representative according to the express text of the regulation

according to Art. 27 Para. 5 DSGVO does not involve any transfer of responsibility -

and the Respondent has at no time argued that the

R*** Hotels GmbH as (jointly) responsible for the present

Processing in connection with the booking platform https://www.alpen***.at/ and in particular the

Processing of the complainant’s personal data is to be considered –

the present decision of the data protection authority is directed against the

Respondent.

2. On the geographical scope of the GDPR

Although the Respondent is not established in the Union, the

Against this background, the GDPR takes place in accordance with Article 3(2)(a) GDPR

the language of a data subject in connection with the possibility of goods and

Ordering services in this language indicates that the

Controller intends to provide goods or services to persons in the Union

as well as the decision of the data protection authority of March 7, 2019 loc.

3. On Art. 13 GDPR as a subjective right of the data subject

The data protection authority has already dealt with the question of whether the "information requirements"

according to Art. 13 and Art. 14 GDPR vice versa as subjective data subject rights

can be asserted, and assumes according to stRsp that

that a data subject can refer to Art. 13 and Art. 14 GDPR independently of the application

can support (cf. the decision of the data protection authority of October 31, 2018,

GZ DSB-D123.076/0003-DSB/2018).

4. On the term "survey", on the provision of information

In the present case, the data protection authority assumes that the

Respondent the data of the complainant (at least first and last name

and his e-mail address) iSv Art. 13 Para. 1 DSGVO thereby "collected", by

As is clear from Recital 58, second sentence GDPR, Art. 12 Para. 1 GDPR

required standard with regard to "easy accessibility" of the information

Art. 13 GDPR can be achieved by storing the information electronically

form, “e.g. on a website if they are for the

intended for the general public".

A response in the form that the information according to Art. 13 GDPR upon collection

are to be proactively sent to a data subject by email is therefore (at least in

online context) not required if the requirement of “ease of access”

is fulfilled (cf. cf. Art. 29 Data Protection Working Party, guidelines for transparency according to the

Regulation 2016/679, WP 260 rev.01, 17/DE, S 22, according to which the information obligation also

can be fulfilled by a data subject “actively directing to the site

where the information is available”, for example via a direct link).

In the present case, however, the Respondent never entered

Meeting led that the information according to Art. 13 GDPR iSd considerations on a

publicly accessible website were "easily accessible" to the complainant.

The Respondent's e-mail of January 23, 2019 also contains no indications

apparent that the Respondent is complying with its obligation to provide information (e.g. a

analogous note: “Information on how we handle your personal data

Data can be found under [Link]).

In this context it should be pointed out that according to Art. 5 Para. 2 in connection with

Art. 24 para. 1 GDPR, the person responsible is responsible for providing evidence that

that the processing (specifically: the provision of the information in accordance with

Art. 13 at the time of collection) in accordance with the GDPR

It must then be clarified whether they will fulfill their obligation to provide information up to the end of the procedure

4. Regarding point 2.

a) Re point 2. a)

The Respondent has in connection with its duty to provide information under Article 13 (1) lit

DSGVO named a "data protection officer" including contact details.

It should be noted that the GDPR does not use the term "data protection officer".

Proceeding from this, it is unclear whether the Respondent's ins

GDPR. From the point of view of the complainant (who was not aware at the time

about it) it would also have been the representative according to Art. 27 DSGVO

Taking into account the precision and

of the person responsible and, if necessary, of his representative, whereby

understand is.

b) Re point 2. b)

The Respondent has in connection with its obligation to provide information according to Art. 13 para. 1

lit. e GDPR generally limited to categories of recipients of the

to name personal data.

The data protection authority goes, although the GDPR the wording "or"

used, against the background of what is expressly stated in Article 5 (1) (a) GDPR

enshrined principle of transparency assumes that the naming of concrete

Recipients should at least be given priority.

If it would cause a disproportionate amount of effort or the concrete

Recipients are not yet known, the person responsible can rely on the naming of

Restrict categories of recipients (cf. on the legal situation according to the directive

95/46/EG the ruling of the Constitutional Court of October 2, 2007, B 227/05, according to which the question

whether in the case of the right to information [in the terminology of the time] recipient or

groups of recipients are to be named, a weighing up is to be carried out in individual cases).

With regard to the naming of "business partner" and "credit reporting agencies" is lacking

more detailed information on the part of the Respondent in any case not comprehensible,

which is why the specific "business partners" and "credit reference agencies" are not mentioned.

In any case, the recipient category "business partner" is too general and

needs to be differentiated in this regard.

The Respondent is therefore required to identify the specific recipients of the

personal data, and if this is not possible or a disproportionate

represents a great deal of effort, the corresponding reasons for this, but in any case more precise

to provide information regarding the recipient category "business partner".

c) Re point 2. c)

The Respondent has in connection with its obligation to provide information under Article 13 (2) lit

GDPR stated that data used for billing and accounting purposes or

are required to fulfill legal obligations, from a request for deletion

would remain unaffected.

It should be noted that the information obligation according to Art. 12 Para. 2 GDPR after the

express regulation text only exists if this is necessary in order to

to ensure fair and transparent processing. The Respondent sees

this requirement of Art. 12 Para. 2 DSGVO apparently as fulfilled by, without

to address this requirement, the information according to paragraph 2 leg. cit. at least

partially made available.

With regard to the information on the storage period, it should be noted that the general

Reference to "billing and accounting purposes" or the "compliance with legal

Obligations" is not sufficient:

On the one hand, this is essentially a repetition of what is stated in Art. 5

Paragraph 1 lit. e GDPR enshrined principle of storage limitation, which also

generally linked to the fact that personal data is only stored for so long

may be used as required for the purposes. On the other hand, this corresponds to

Obligations of an entrepreneur in Switzerland) to research.

The Respondent is therefore required to be sufficiently understandable and precise

Information regarding the duration for which the personal data

be saved or, if this is not possible, the criteria for the determination

d) Re point 2. d)

Based on the information subsequently provided on January 23, 2019

apparent that the Respondent has complied with its duty to provide information pursuant to Art. 15 para. 2

lit. e GDPR until the conclusion of the procedure before the data protection authority

obviously not complied.

The Respondent is therefore required to communicate whether the provision of the

personal data required by law or contract or for a

Conclusion of the contract is necessary, whether the data subject is obliged to

provide personal data, and what the possible consequences of that

non-provision would have.

e) Re point 2. e)

Based on the information subsequently provided on January 23, 2019

evident that the Respondent has complied with its duty to provide information pursuant to Art. 15 (2) lit. f

DSGVO until the conclusion of the procedure before the data protection authority

has not complied.

The Respondent is therefore required to provide information about the existence of a

f) Re point 2. f)

The respondent has the personal data of the complainant -

Notwithstanding the admissibility of this request, which is not the subject of the proceeding,

has arisen.

Based on the information subsequently provided on January 23, 2019

apparent that the Respondent has complied with its obligation to provide information under Art. 15 para. 3

DSGVO until the conclusion of the procedure before the data protection authority

has not complied.

The Respondent is therefore required to state whether it intends to

further process personal data for a purpose other than that for which

the personal data were collected and, if so, likewise

Include information about this other purpose.

g) To the performance mandate

It should be noted that in the case of a successful complaint pursuant to Section 24 (5) DSG only

However, the prerequisite is the existence of a real legal gap (cf. VwGH

10.10.2018, Ra 2018/08/0189 Rs 4 mwN).

It should be pointed out that the Austrian legislature in the course of the adjustment

of the DSG to the GDPR in § 24 para. 5 and para. 6 DSG apparently not

In addition, it should be pointed out that the directly standardized in the GDPR
