REASON

A. Submissions of the parties and course of the proceedings

1. With a submission dated June 18, 2019 (ha. received on July 18, 2019), the

Complainant violated the right to secrecy and brought

summarized, that they each own half of the GST-NR *3*5/4

in EZ 7*1, GB *3*2 H***dorf, with the residential building built on it K***weg *2b.

The respondents each own half of the property GST-NR *3*5/5,

presented in EZ 3*31, GB *3*2 H***dorf with the residential building built on it

K***way *2c. The respondents had been at their house since November 2018

installed a camera and have been using it for several months for parts of the

monitor the complainants' property.

In this regard, there is already a procedure before the BG L***stadt for GZ *3 C *25/19t

pending where the plaintiffs are seeking an injunction with respect to that camera

brought against the Respondents. A verdict in this case is pending

not yet issued.

The camera in question is under the gable of the garage roof of the residential building

K***weg *2c, presented in EZ 3*31, GB *3*2 H***dorf, positioned. It is

here a swiveling camera and was off the property of the complainant

very clearly visible. Through the installed camera, which is clearly on the property

the complainant was addressed or constant monitoring of the property

the complainant suggests that the personality rights of the

Complainant's respect for private life significantly affected.

2. The Data Protection Authority granted by letter dated August 8, 2019,

GZ: DSB-D124.1078/0001-DSB/2019, the request to file a lawsuit regarding

GZ *3 C *25/19t to submit pending proceedings before the BG L***stadt and the

to announce the time of filing the lawsuit.

3. The complainants complied with the request within the time limit set

Entry dated September 06, 2019. The time of filing the lawsuit was

Announced January 21, 2019. The following documents were submitted

enclosed:

 Complaint dated January 21, 2019
 Preparatory brief from 07.02.2019
 Minutes of 04/25/2019
 Settlement revocation dated April 30, 2019
 Minutes of 03/04/2019
 Judgment of the BG L***stadt from 05.07.2019, GZ: *3 C *25/19t

 

In addition, the complainants admitted that the judgment of the

BG L***stadt from July 5th, 2019, GZ: *3 C *25/19t known.

The judgment includes the following points:

"1. The defendants are guilty of failing to provide a permanently installed

aiming the video camera at the plaintiffs' property.

2. The defendants are obligated to pay the plaintiffs the EUR

5,774.64 (including EUR 820.02 in VAT and EUR 854.50 in cash expenses)

to reimburse certain procedural costs."

 

B. Subject of Complaint

Based on the submissions of the complainants, it must first be examined whether the

Data protection authority based on the judgment of the District Court of L***stadt on July 5th

2019, *3 C *25/19t, on the decision in the case at hand

responsible is.

C. Findings of Facts

The data protection authority shall put the data recorded under point A on file

documented factual basis of their decision.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. On the identity of the thing:

The judgment of the L***stadt District Court of July 5, 2019, GZ: *3 C *25/19t, and the

The present complaint is based on the same subject (identity of the

Matter).

Even if Art. 77 and Art. 79 GDPR give the impression that a parallel or

successive proceedings before a supervisory authority and a court possible

seems, it cannot be the purpose of the GDPR, first a court with the question

the lawfulness of a particular processing of personal data

deal only with the same question after the conclusion of the instance of answering

to a supervisory authority (cf. Nemitz in Ehmann/Selmayr2, data protection

Basic Ordinance [2018] Art. 79 margin no. 8).

With the judgment of the L***stadt district court of July 5th, the complainants rule

2019 already has a legally binding and enforceable legal remedy for production

of the lawful state. A gradual use of

Data protection authority in the same matter is out of the question, especially since

The complainant's need for legal protection is already fully covered by the judgment

was taken into account. A complaint is therefore no longer accepted.

2. Regarding the application for the imposition of a fine:

The complainants' express request for

imposition of a fine on the respondents.

It should be noted that a subjective right to initiate criminal proceedings

against a certain person responsible not from Art. 77 Para. 1 DSGVO or § 24 Para. 1

and 5 DSG is to be derived and, in addition, according to § 25 para. 1 VStG the principle of

Official expediency applies (cf. Fister in Lewisch/Fister/Weilguni [editors], VStG comment2 [2017]

Section 25 margin number 1).

Administrative penal proceedings can therefore only be initiated by a person concerned

there is no entitlement to the initiation of such.

Overall, therefore, the decision had to be made in accordance with the verdict.
