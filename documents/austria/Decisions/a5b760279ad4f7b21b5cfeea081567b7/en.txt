S P R U C H

The data protection authority decides on the privacy complaint of the minor

A*** F*** (complainant), represented by the guardian Z*** F***, dated

August 21, 2018 against N***Netzwerk GmbH & Co KG (respondent).

Violation of the right to secrecy as follows:

- The appeal is upheld and it is established that the Respondent

the complainant thereby in the right to secrecy according to § 1 para. 1 DSG

has violated by lack of appropriate technical and organizational

Measures in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR ("Security of processing") has enabled that with

the email address ***@***.com of the minor complainant, but without his

Knowledge, the profile "***geilab14" on the operated by the Respondent

Online dating portal www.dates***.com and the profile "bernd***" on the also from the

Respondent-operated dating portal www.***frauen.com was created and the

Complainants as a result of ongoing "contact suggestions" and notifications of

Respondent to his e-mail address ***@***.com.

Legal basis: Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation -

GDPR), OJ No. L 119 of 4.5.2016; § 1 para. 1 and 2 as well as § 24 para. 1 and 5 of the

Data Protection Act - DSG, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended.

REASON

A. Submissions of the parties and course of the proceedings

1. Z*** F***, as the legal representative of the minor complainant, brought A*** F***

with submission of August 21, 2018, improved with submission of November 03, 2018 and with

Submission of November 18, 2018, complaint and alleging violation of

Art. 5, Art. 6, Art. 7 and Art. 8 GDPR.

In summary, he submitted that the e-mail address of the minor

Complainant ***@***.com was used without his knowledge to profile

"***geilab14" on the online dating portal operated by the Respondent

www.dates***.com and the profile "bernd ***" on which is also from the Respondent

operated dating portal www.***frauen.com to register. This has led to

the underage complainant constantly sends dating or sex offers to his e-mail

address ***@***.com.

A registration – according to the legally represented complainant – and access

to the online portal (“dates***”) with any e-mail address and without

Integrity check according to Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR possible. It may happen

Forwarding to third parties not mentioned in the data protection declaration such as (e.g. "***-Date",

"l***").

On June 24, 2018, Z*** F*** received messages in the minor's inbox

complainant found. It is not possible to unsubscribe from the notifications

been. He immediately sent a cease and desist message to the respondent

transmitted and pointed out that the complainant was a minor. On July 08, 2018

I urged Z*** F*** to reply, which he received on August 10, 2018. It have

further e-mail correspondence with the Respondent. The minor

Complainant has the two profiles "***geilab14" and "bernd***" for the e-mail address

***@***.com certainly not self-created. Rather, it can be assumed that a

unknown person the two profiles on those operated by the Respondent

created online dating portals.

The complaint is directed against the fact that creating a profile on the - from the

Respondent operated - online dating portals without double opt-in procedure and

possible without verifying the age of the "interested party" requesting via e-mail address

may be. Z*** F*** can prove on the basis of a "self-test" that has been carried out that for the

Creation of a profile and subsequent use of the Respondent's services

the mere registration with an e-mail address without carrying out a double opt-in

procedure is sufficient.

For the two profiles "***geilab14" and "bernd***" - so the legally represented

Complainant further - there is no confirmation of the implementation of the double opt-in

Procedure and an age check, which the sending of sex offers to the as well

legitimize the disclosure of the complainant's e-mail address ***@***.com.

2. In its statement of February 8, 2019, the Respondent brought

Essentially, that requires a user to create a profile on the one they operate

Online dating portals www.dates***.com and www.***frauen.com his gender, the

Enter the desired user name, password and an e-mail address as well as the

accept the Respondent's Terms and Conditions and Entertainment Policy.

After registration, the user will receive an email to the specified address

Message asking them to activate their profile or provide their email address

confirm. The user can also log in without activating his profile or confirmation

log into his profile with his email address, but he would be prompted again

be asked to confirm their email address. He also had to state his age.

The profile can only be activated after clicking on the activation link sent to the e-mail

address of the user will be activated. The user cannot change his profile

activate if he does not have access to the e-mail address used. Only after

After activation, the user will receive another e-mail.

3. By letter from the data protection authority dated February 15, 2019 to GZ: DSB-D130.073/0001-

DSB/2019 the respondent became the supplementary as follows

Opinion requested:

"The DSB understands your statement to the effect that a user (after creation

his profile) can then already log into his profile on your website without the

Activation link - in the message sent to his email address - to activate

have to. Is that right?

Which services can the user use if he has logged into his profile, although he

not activated yet? Please demonstrate this with screenshots.”

4. In a statement dated February 28, 2019, the Respondent submitted the following:

“We are happy to answer your questions as follows.

It is correct that the user logs in after registration and explicit confirmation
his age and place of residence and the request to send his DoubleOptIn email
confirm that the portal can be used to a limited extent.

The request to confirm his DoubleOptIn email comes regularly
Rhythm (every 3-5 minutes) within the portal as long as the user does not confirm this
has.

It is possible for the user to make limited use of some services on the portal.
We have attached the following screenshots as an example.”

 

[Editor's note: the graphic inserted at this point in the original
Files/screenshots were removed because they were not pseudonymised with reasonable effort
can become.]

4. The complainant brought in the context of the hearing of the parties with a statement of

March 22, 2019 summarized that based on the documents submitted by him

it has been proven that even without activating the profile, messages are actually only sent to the

email address to be confirmed would be sent. That in the opinion of

The double opt-in procedure mentioned by the Respondent does not apply, certainly

also to encourage potential users to activate the profile. He can

- so the legally represented complainant further - via a test account if necessary

prove. He could not make a reasonable effort to realize that the real age

the user will be determined.

Despite the lack of profile activation via the double opt-in procedure, the minor

Unsolicited inappropriate contact requests have been sent to the complainant.

In summary, the legally represented complainant - even after knowing the

Respondent's comments on the registration procedure for their

Online dating portals - from a violation of the GDPR by unlawful

Processing/use of the e-mail address ***@***.com.

B. Subject of Complaint

Based on the submissions of the legally represented complainant, it follows that

The subject of the complaint is whether the respondent is the complainant

thereby violated the right to secrecy by failing to provide suitable information

Messages came from the online dating portals www.***frauen.com and

www.dates***.com of the Respondent. The news, on the other hand, concerned that on that

Online dating portal www.dates***.com set up profile "***geilab14" and on the

Online dating portal www.***frauen.com set up profile "bernd***" and included under

other "contact suggestions". Both profiles were on the email address ***@***.com des

Evidence: This results from the credible submissions of the

On June 5, 2018, the profile "***geilab14" was published on the online dating portal www.dates***.com

the complainant then a list of those stored about his person

Information that reveals when the "***geilab14" and "brnd***" profiles appeared on the email

address of the complainant ***@***.com.

The underage complainant created the two profiles "***geilab14" and "bernd***",

who were registered to his email address ***@***.com and to which he

received notifications from the Respondent on both profiles, not itself.

Evidence: That the minor complainant did not own the profiles

"***geilab14" and "bernd***" is based on the one hand on the credible

Submissions of the legally represented minor complainant who

express request of the data protection authority in the letter of September 19, 2018

Answer from October 14, 2018 said no, the two profiles "***geilab14" and "bernd***" with

to have created his own email address ***@***.com. In addition, the

Data protection authority in the meantime with further - to the business number D145.050 as well as to

Business number D124.788 and business number D124.1053 - complaints

concerning the same Respondent confronted in which the respective complainants

consistently claim to have received "spam mails" from the Respondent without

ever to have created a profile on the Respondent's online dating portals. in the

Overall, it therefore seems plausible to the data protection authority that the e-mail

Addresses of uninvolved third parties - i.e. people who do not have a profile on the

online dating portals of the Respondent - for spam mails

Respondent are used.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

The complainant relies - after the data protection authority with

improvement order dated November 12, 2018 - to a violation of the

Art. 5, Art. 6 and Art. 32 GDPR (in conjunction with § 1 DSG). Now they are

Rights of data subjects exhaustively in Chapter III GDPR, namely in Articles 12 to 23 GDPR,

enumerated. According to the case law of the data protection authority, a data subject can

also to any provision outside of Chapter III GDPR - thus also to Art. 32 GDPR

- based, if this results in a possible violation of the law

Confidentiality according to § 1 Para. 1 DSG (cf. the decision of the

Data Protection Authority of September 13, 2018, DSB-D123.070/0005-DSB/2018, according to which a

Violation of the person responsible against Art. 32 DSGVO to a violation of § 1 Abs. 1 DSG

can lead). Accordingly, there was a violation of the right to

To check secrecy according to § 1 Abs. 1 DSG.

According to § 1 para. 1 DSG everyone has, in particular with regard to the respect of his

Private and family life, right to secrecy of those concerning him

personal data, insofar as there is a legitimate interest in it.

E-mail addresses are personal data in accordance with Art. 4 Z 1 GDPR.

This means that the email address ***@***.com is a personal date of

is a minor complainant.

Unauthorized use of e-mail addresses can, according to the legal opinion of

In any case, the data protection authority violates Art. 5, Art. 6 and Art. 32 GDPR and thus

represent a possible violation of Section 1 (1) DSG:

As can be seen from Art. 32 GDPR, there is an obligation on the part of the person responsible or

of the processor on the security of the processing of personal data. Article 32

GDPR focuses its standard content on “technical and organizational

Measures”. The GDPR uses these terms in numerous other places than

normative starting point, in particular in Article 5 Paragraph 1 Letter f, Article 24 Paragraph 1 Clause 1,

Art. 25 para. 1 and para. 2 sentence 1, Art. 28 para. 1 and Art. 89 para. 1 sentence 2 (...). The topos means everyone

Measures aimed at processing in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR (cf.

see Martini in Paal/Pauly, General Data Protection Regulation [2017], Art. 32 margin no. 28). This

Security can be taken into account the elements specified in paragraph 1 of this provision

can be guaranteed in several ways. For example, such a

Data protection security measure in the implementation of a double opt-in procedure

to obtain a legally compliant consent:

The “double opt-in procedure” generally involves obtaining the

Declaration of consent of the participant understood in a two-tier system, the one

Registration to obtain electronic information, for example on the provider's website

provides, in a first step, the individual message to the specified email address

or the specified telephone connection, after which for this address or this

Subsequent registration has taken place. Only after an on this (individual) mail or the

answer given in a short message confirming the registration or similar

Response (e.g. clicking on a link) will be sent advertising messages (cf

the decision of the Administrative Court of June 26, 2013, Zl. 2012/03/0089 with further references).

As the Respondent itself submits, it is already a user after the

Registration by logging into his profiles on the websites www.***frauen.com and

www.dates***.com possible to use the Respondent's online dating portals. for

the use of the Respondent's online dating portals, the user must

Address that he gave when registering, not again by clicking on one

"Activation links" sent to the e-mail address given during registration

was sent, confirm.

The Respondent also does not wait to send "contact suggestions"

until the user completes his registration via an activation link, which he clicks on - upon registration

specified – e-mail address has been confirmed again. Much more

sends the Respondent - even without clicking on the activation link - to the

E-mail address provided during registration continuously with their notifications.

As a result, this means that the Respondent did not use a double opt-in procedure

used.

It is therefore possible - as in the present case - that a user does not register with his own

e-mail address, but with the e-mail address of an uninvolved third party on the

online dating portals of the Respondent can register. As a result, this user

Use the Respondent's services without ever entering the e-mail account of the

having to enter the e-mail address provided during registration. The uninvolved third party

However, whose e-mail address is used for registration on the online dating portals

received notifications (“contact suggestions”) from the respondent

sent his e-mail address without ever being on the online dating portals of the

to have registered the complainant.

That is exactly what happened in the present case: the e-mail address of the minor

Complainant ***@***.com was used by unknown person(s) to create

used by two profiles on the Respondent's online dating portals.

Due to the fact that the Respondent did not have sufficient, Art. 32 DSGVO

has taken appropriate data security measures, it was possible that

personal data of the complainant - namely the e-mail address ***@***.com -

have been unlawfully processed, depriving the complainant of his fundamental right

Confidentiality according to § 1 Abs. 1 DSG violated.

To claim for damages

Regarding the claim for damages raised by the complainant

data protection authority incompetent. According to § 29 Para. 2 DSG, the local authority is responsible for this

appeal to the provincial court.
