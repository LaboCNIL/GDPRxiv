B. Subject of Complaint

In a first step, the question must first be clarified as to whether the complainant pursuant to Article 77 GDPR

has the right to submit the relevant data to the Austrian data protection authority

to submit a data protection complaint and whether the Austrian data protection authority for the content

treatment is responsible.

C. Findings of Facts

The applicant, a Romanian citizen, resides in the Republic of Romania. He is

General Director of the Moldovan pharmaceutical company “P*** Farm SRL”.

Evidence: Letter from the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Moldova to Alexandru A***; copy of

Appellant's passport.

Not a single controller against whom the complainant filed a request for erasure

has its registered office in Austria. The vast majority of requests for deletion are against

Responsible in the Republic of Moldova (otherwise the seat is Romania or Hong Kong

indicated). In addition to the country-specific top-level domain of Romania (.ro) and the generic

Top-level domain (.com) - related websites are in Romanian or English

held - the majority of the websites of those responsible end where they claimed

discriminatory content can be seen, with the top-level domain of the Republic of Moldova (.md) and are

these are held in Russian or Romanian.

Evidence: Complainant's letter of 21 February 2019, Complainant's letter

dated February 16, 2019.

The complainant justifies the competence of the Austrian data protection authority

in particular with "[...] My opinion is that the Austrian data protection authority has solved the problem

better than [the] Romanian data protection authority can resolve. [...]".

Evidence: Complainant's letter dated 29 January 2019.

D. In legal terms it follows

D.1. General

According to Art. 77 GDPR, each data subject has the right to do so, without prejudice to anything else

administrative or judicial remedy, the right to lodge a complaint with a

Supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, your

workplace or the place of the alleged infringement if the data subject believes

that the processing of personal data concerning you violates this regulation

violates.

adults 141 states that every data subject should have the right to

supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence

to submit and seek an effective judicial remedy in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter,

if they see their rights under this regulation violated or if the supervisory authority

does not act upon a complaint, rejects or rejects a complaint in whole or in part

or does not act, although this is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject.

D.2. In the matter

The complainant has his habitual residence in Romania, is the director general of the in

of the Republic of Moldova established company "P*** Farm S.R.L" and is the place of

- 5 –

 

alleged violations in none of the cases in Austria. The alleged violations

are mainly attributed to those responsible whose registered office is indicated with "Republic of Moldova".

There is also no other connection to Austria. Thus, none of the in Art. 77 GDPR

after the term "in particular" demonstratively listed variants regarding the possibility of

filing a privacy complaint.

The only reference to possible jurisdiction is the Austrian data protection authority

the fact that the complainant brought the privacy complaint to her and that

the complainant is fluent in German.

Even if the wording ("in particular") of Art 77 GDPR and that of Recital 141 it

suggest that a complaint can be lodged with any supervisory authority within the meaning of the GDPR

it must be countered that it cannot be the sense and purpose of Art 77 GDPR,

to declare supervisory authorities competent to lodge a complaint, to which none

there is an objective connection. The aim of the GDPR is to enable the exercise of legal protection interests

facilitate by enabling data subjects to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority

submitted to which there is a spatial and/or linguistic close relationship. So it is not

more - as required by the legal situation in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC - to lodge a complaint

to the supervisory authority in whose district the person responsible is based.

Nevertheless, Art. 77 GDPR cannot be understood as allowing a completely free

Election of authorities (“forum shopping”), bypassing supervisory authorities, which may have a

proper conduct of the proceedings is not trusted, but to which there is an objective connection in the above

described sense exists.

Merely the argument "that the Austrian data protection authority is able to solve the problem better than [the]

Romanian data protection authority can dissolve”, is thus for a justification of jurisdiction

regarding the filing of the data protection complaint with the Austrian data protection authority

to be regarded as insufficient.

Due to a lack of jurisdiction, the appeal lodged was therefore in accordance with the verdict

to reject.
