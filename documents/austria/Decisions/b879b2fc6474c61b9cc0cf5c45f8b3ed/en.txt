Use and publication of personal results […]” for the purpose of

Creation of a contemporary historical publication, namely a local chronicle on the occasion

The local chronicle was created on behalf of the local community of P***berg

T***kirchen.

The results of all historical research would be published in the form of a book

Total volume of approx. 300 A4 pages, in an edition of 1,000, on October 27th

Presented in 2018 as part of the community's anniversary celebrations. The publication

pursue neither profit nor damage intention and be partisan as well

denominationally independent.

In the chapter "Houses" is the presentation of the history of ownership of the individual houses

intended. This so-called “house book” has not only been in use for many years

popular, but also from a professional point of view essential subject area in

Local chronicles throughout Austria. The history of the house and farm goes back to time

of the earliest available records of feudalism and furnish

such key insights into local and population history. For the full

Presentation of the occupation history up to the present are next to the old ones

Land registers or manorial land registers and records also

publicly accessible current land register data required.

It is due to the GDPR for use or publication

of the persons concerned is required. The local community P***berg near T***kirchen has

over 402 house numbers, which results in an estimated group of up to 1,000 people

potential owners to be interviewed (including former owners who are still alive

owners) who not only contacted, but also asked for concrete written

Feedback or approval must be requested.

Obtaining the declarations of consent in this case means one

disproportionate effort. Determining whether former

Property owners are deceased or not, is due to the

legal blocking period for death registers is also only possible with great difficulty.

A. Findings of Facts

intention to cause damage and is independent of party politics and denomination.

Jubilee celebrations of the community are presented. It will include a chapter with

include the name "Houses", in which the presentation of the ownership stories of the

History of the house and court up to the time of the earliest available records

an estimated group of up to 1,000 potential owners to be interviewed

Death books, the inspection of which would be necessary to find out whether former

property owners are deceased or not.

have personal results as their goal (see, for example, Jahnel, data protection law,

438 [2010] on Section 46 (2) DSG 2000 with the same content in this regard). According to § 7 paragraph 2

is made credible (Z 3) [...]". These requirements must be cumulative.

With regard to the criterion of § 7 Para. 3 Z 1 DSG, the number of

data subjects, the age of the data or any appropriate safeguards

drawn. If, for example, no contact details are available, these would first have to be collected,

which is a disproportionately high effort for a large number of people

could represent. It may also be that due to the age of the data, the persons

many have already died. § 7 Para. 3 Z 1 DSG is fulfilled, among other things, if the size

of the group of persons concerned the disproportionality of the investigation

stretches (see Gantschacher†/Spanberger in

Gantschacher†/Jelinek/Schmidl/Spanberger, Commentary on the Data Protection Act [2018],

§ 7 Note 10).

If special categories of personal data are processed, according to § 7

The established facts lead to the conclusion that with regard to this

point, there is no data processing subject to approval.

The approval in the sense of § 7 para. 3 DSG only refers to the case at hand

(In particular the transmission of the local chronicle to the municipality of P***berg near T***kirchen

or the publication of the same at the anniversary celebration). After that he

data processing is permitted.

Since in this point there was no case of approval at all, the application was

to be dismissed in this regard.

B.2. In the matter (points 1, 3 and 4):

According to the established facts and the legal situation presented at the beginning, both that

securing data secrecy.

provisions. Granting permission to process data for

scientific or historical research purposes is not exempt from the fee and

Tax exemption clause of Section 69 (6) DSG.
