public transport) as follows:

 

- The request for prior consultation under Art. 36 GDPR is rejected.

 

Legal basis: Articles 35, 36 (1) and 58 (3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

(General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR), OJ No. L 119 of 4.5.2016 p. 1.

REASON

A. Submissions of those responsible:

1. By letter of October 30, 2018, the person responsible consulted the

Data protection authority according to Art. 36 GDPR.

Those responsible intend twelve video cameras in the "A*** Business Park B***stadt".

with a focus on the street entrance areas of the business park and on

set up secondary dirt roads. This for the purpose of property and

property protection as well as to protect the employees working in the business park, since in

there had been repeated burglaries and thefts in the past.

From the data protection impact assessment carried out in accordance with Art. 35 GDPR

Although it is clear that the identified risks are due to the to be taken

Corrective actions are rated as very low, but monitoring

of public transport roads in general, regardless of the measures taken

associated with a high risk and is therefore a prior consultation of the

Data protection authority required to ensure that the

DPA agrees that the proposed processing entails the risk

sufficiently reduced and the person responsible within the meaning of the GDPR act.

2. The responsible person brought along - at the request of the data protection authority

Statement of December 14, 2018 additionally states that the person responsible

have taken measures to contain the risk, which is why the

Scope of application of Art. 36 Para. 1 GDPR is not open in principle, however

remains questionable as to whether the measures are also suitable for reducing the risk

limit to an acceptable level. This in particular against the background that the

planned video surveillance is associated with a considerable expenditure of time and money

may be.

B. Findings of fact:

The person responsible intends to set up in the "A*** Business Park B***stadt".

twelve video surveillance cameras.

The data protection impact assessment carried out by the responsible party showed that

due to the planned data processing, there are low to high risks for data subjects

present. A high risk is specifically only when monitoring visitors to the

Access roads given, since this is the monitoring of roads of the

public transport.

Due to the corrective measures planned in the data protection impact assessment

However, all identified risks can ultimately be classified as very low

will.

Evidence assessment: The findings made result from the

procedural application.

C. In legal terms it follows that:

According to Art. 36 Para. 1 GDPR, the person responsible consults the before processing

Supervisory authority if from a data protection impact assessment according to Art. 35

leg.cit. shows that the processing would result in a high risk if the

responsible person does not take any measures to contain the risk.

As noted, the data protection impact assessment pursuant to Art. 35 GDPR showed that

that in principle there is a high risk when monitoring visitors

Access roads are given, however, this risk was taken care of by those responsible

ultimately classified as very low due to the remedial measures to be taken.

If, as part of the consultation process, the person responsible receives confirmation of the

Data Protection Authority seeks that the measure taken by it actually as

are to be regarded as suitable for curbing the identified risks, it fails to recognize

that this is not the subject of a procedure under Art. 36 GDPR. Such

Assessment of the remedial measures taken is the sole responsibility of those responsible

itself and a consultation of the data protection authority according to Art. 36 GDPR only comes into play

applicable to those cases in which the person responsible fails to

adequately contain the identified risks (cf. the guidelines of the data protection working group

according to Article 29 on the data protection impact assessment (DPIA) and answering the

Ask whether processing within the meaning of Regulation 2016/679 is “probable

entails high risk”, WP 248 Rev.01, p. 23; and Recital 94 of the

GDPR).

In other words: only in cases where the person responsible does not have sufficient

Measures can be taken to reduce the risks to an acceptable level

can be reduced (i.e. there are still high residual risks), a consultation of the

Supervisory authority required (cf. again the cited guidelines, p. 23 with further references).

The prerequisites for prior consultation in accordance with Art. 36 GDPR are therefore

not given and it was therefore to be decided according to the verdict.
