Complainant summed up that the Respondent him in his right

violated secrecy.

The respondent's branch manager had asked for a photo ID to be presented,

as the complainant paid the sum of EUR 100 in Turkish Lira (TRY)

switch

wanted to leave. The complainant, who was a former customer of the

Respondent initially refused, but eventually got his driver's license

submitted. As a result, the Respondent had the Appellant's driver's license

copied and stored, with the Respondent retaining the copy. the

Respondent's demands for an identity check are excessive and

done without a legal basis. The complainant pointed out that the

Respondent in a written information addressed to him on May 3, 2019 on the

FM-GwG and both the branch manager of the respondent and the

Respondent itself the personal data of the complainant

had improperly collected and used. The complainant also complained that

Violation of Art. 9 GDPR.

2. With completion (GZ: DSB-D124.720/0003-DSB-2019) of June 28, 2019, the

Data Protection Authority invites the Respondent to comment.

3. By letter dated July 26, 2019 (received July 31, 2019)

shared the

Respondent with that the currency change from EUR to TRY or the order

a foreign currency, which requires the collection of identity data, so that the necessary

Cash deposit can be assigned as a credit on the customer collective account.

In addition, the Respondent, due to the 4th EU Money Laundering Directive

Furthermore, the Respondent has the obligation pursuant to § 21 para. 1 FM-GwG,

4. With completion (GZ: DSB-D124.720/0004-DSB/2019) of July 31, 2019, the

Data protection authority the BF party hearing.

5. With a submission of August 21, 2019, the complainant commented and stated that

that it is incomprehensible that the Respondent in collecting the

Identity data based on the allocation of the credit, since he received a receipt from the bank

received the deposit of 100 euros for the currency exchange and with this receipt

each person was able to withdraw the Turkish Lira amount,

therefore, an identity check was not necessary.

Furthermore, the Respondent or the head of the bank office is wrong if it

it will be assumed that the person complaining is a

Act officials of a higher federal authority, since he was during the time of

customer relationship with the Respondent was a customs officer. Also with his

current position is the designation "legal employee". out of it

it follows that Section 2 no. 6 in conjunction with Section 11 FM-GwG is not applicable to the complainant.

The Respondent had argued legally incorrectly with regard to the FM-GwG.

In doing so, the complainant leads the circular of the Financial Market Authority dated

18.12.2018 regarding the "due diligence to prevent money laundering and

Terrorism Financing” and the guidelines of the H***-Bank, according to which 100 euros are not under

the FM-GWG falls because the value limit of EUR 1,000.00 or EUR 15,000 is not exceeded

had been. It follows that the Respondent without any legal basis

requested the complainant's identity data.

6. With completion (GZ: DSB-D124.720/0006-DSB/2019) of November 15, 2019, the

Data protection authority again asked the respondent to comment.

7. The Respondent replied by electronic and postal letter dated

4 December 2019 (ha. received 9 December 2019) a statement in which they

stated that there are overlaps in the removal of ordered foreign currencies

can come to the customer collective account. To prevent the

foreign currency amount would be paid out to another customer

Identification document required.

The complainant misjudges the legal situation, since the value limit of EUR 1,000.00

only refer to the facts of § 5 Z 2 lit. b FM-GwG. On the other hand, § 5 Z 4 FM-

GwG a fact that is based on subjective criteria. Therefore, the bank employees

If there are any doubts, identity documents must be requested in accordance with section 6 (1) no. 1 FM-GwG. Of the

Bank branch manager had to decide without investigation and is not in a position

been to check whether the complainant is actually a political

exposed person act.

8. With completion (GZ: DSB-D124.720/0007-DSB/2019) of December 10, 2019, the

Data Protection Authority again invited the complainant to be heard as a party.

9. No further submissions were made by the complainant.

this not about the purpose and not (sufficiently) about the means of the objectively relevant

data processing, since he was doing so in compliance with the specifications of his

employer acted.

First of all, it should also be noted that in the present case a violation of the law

is to be checked for secrecy according to § 1 para. 1 DSG and restrictions of this

D2. To restrict the right to secrecy:

According to Section 1 (2) DSG, restrictions on the right to secrecy are only permissible

if the use of personal data is in the vital interest of the

Affected or with his consent, in the case of overriding legitimate interests

In the present case, there are no vital interests of the complainant

recognizable, and there was also no consent to data processing. It must therefore be checked

First of all, whether a legal basis as a permit is possible or available.

On the legal basis:

In the present case, the Respondent submitted that, in accordance with the requirements

of the FM-GwG is legally obliged to establish the identity of the complainant and

the copies for a period of five years after the end of the business relationship with the

Retain customers or after the time of an occasional transaction.

In general, it can be said that the FM-GwG aims to prevent money laundering and

to prevent the financing of terrorism and therefore, among other things, certain credit institutions

duties of care imposed.

However, not every transaction constitutes a transaction in favor of the above

frowned upon purposes.

As stated, the Respondent is N*** Bank AG and

as a credit institution within the meaning of Section 2 no. 1 FM-GwG, this is subject to the provisions of the FM-GwG.

The Respondent's legal duty of care results from § 6 Para. 1 Z 1 FM-

GwG and includes the "determination of the identity of the customer and verification of the identity

based on documents, data or information obtained from a credible and

independent source".

§ 5 Z 2 FM-GwG standardizes that in occasional transactions the due diligence of the

§ 6 FM-GwG are to be applied under the following conditions:

a) the amount of which is at least 15,000 euros or the equivalent in euros, namely
regardless of whether the transaction is in a single operation or in several
Operations between which there is an obvious connection, is carried out, or

b) which are money transfers within the meaning of Art. 3 Z 9 of Regulation (EU) 2015/847

is more than 1 000 euros;

 

The complainant's change of money in the equivalent of 100 euros was

by an amount below the value limit of § 5 Z 2 FM-GwG, so the

Due diligence obligations of Section 5 no. 2 FM-GwG do not apply to the complainant.

According to § 5 Z 4 FM-GwG, the obligated party already has suspicion of money laundering

or terrorist financing apply the due diligence measures. The argument of

Respondent that a priori or through the refusal of the complainant, a

Present photo ID suspected of money laundering or terrorist financing

would have arisen is not followed:

From the established facts and from the submissions of the parties to the proceedings

there are no indications that the complainant has behaved conspicuously,

that would justify an identity check pursuant to Section 5 no. 4 FM-GwG. the bare

Questions or the refusal to present an identity card cannot be made without further ado

Evidence leads to a legitimate reason to believe that a

Affected party objectively participates in transactions that constitute money laundering under Section 165 of the Criminal Code -

including assets that result from a criminal act by

The Respondent also stated that an identity check according to § 6

FM-GwG was justified because it had to be checked whether the complainant

found out was the bank manager

Complainant admits that this is an employee of a "higher

federal authority”. However, an employee of a "higher federal authority" is not

equivalent to the PeP property of § 2 Z 6 FM-GwG, where for example

heads of state, members of parliament or judges of the Constitutional Court

will.

Here it becomes clear that the complainant, even with only rudimentary knowledge of

the complainant's position does not meet any of the facts listed there.

Incidentally, with regard to the examination of whether the complainant is a PeP, it would be more lenient

Means in the sense of § 1 paragraph 2 last sentence DSG an inquiry came into consideration.

The Respondent's determination of the Complainant's identity was

View of the data protection authority therefore not covered by § 1 para. 2 DSG and thus

unlawful.

For consent:

Art. 4 Z 11 GDPR defines consent as “every voluntary for the specific case, in

informed manner and unequivocally given expression of will in the form of a

Statement or other clear confirmatory action with which the data subject

person indicates that they are concerned with the processing

consent to personal data".

In accordance with Art. 7 Para. 4 GDPR and taking into account Art. 4 Z 11 and EG 43

GDPR, consent must be given voluntarily and may not be linked to the fulfillment of a

contract, although this consent to the performance of this contract is not

is required. Consent is involuntary if the failure to give consent

a disadvantage is to be expected (cf. the decision of the data protection authority of April 16th

2019, GZ DSB-D213.679/0003-DSB/2018).

In the present case, the question arises as to whether the complainant consented to the

processing of his personal data (driver's license) or whether this is valid

has come about and meets the requirements set out in the GDPR.

As can be seen from the findings, the complainant makes in his submissions

clear that he has not voluntarily consented to the processing of his driving license since

otherwise the desired change of money would not have been carried out and he would not have submitted it

could have expected a disadvantage from his driving licence.

Consent to the processing of the complainant's personal data was

also not required for currency exchange into Turkish Lira (TRY) as the

Complainant a receipt for the deposit of 100 euros for the currency exchange

received and the transfer was therefore attributable to the receipt. The processing

driving license was not necessary.

The data processing in question therefore proves to be unlawful

The data protection authority therefore comes to the conclusion that based on the examination of the

transaction were not applicable. Therefore, the processing of the

there was also no approval or other permissible limitation of the

secrecy claim iSd. § 1 para. 2 DSG, which is why a violation of the right to

secrecy exists.

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.

Regarding point 2:

Since the requirements for the processing of the data at issue are not met

were present, they were processed unlawfully from the outset, which is why, pursuant to Art. 17

Para. 1 lit. d GDPR are to be deleted.
