The Respondent then informed the Appellant by letter dated

that

because of

of

unexcused no-show

Evidence assessment: These findings result from what is insofar consistent

Submissions of the parties to the proceedings and the submitted enclosures.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

According to Art. 15 GDPR, a data subject has the right to obtain a

to request confirmation as to whether they are processing personal data relating to them

become. If this is the case, the person concerned also has the right to information about

this personal data and the data specified in Art. 15 (1) lit. a to h leg. cit. mentioned

Information, also, if necessary, additionally about the information according to paragraph 2 of the

Determination.

Furthermore, according to Art. 15 Para. 3 leg. cit. an affected person

Copies of the personal data that are the subject of the processing are available

to be provided if requested by the data subject.

If the respondent states that the complainant in the course of the

Access to files would have been possible in full, insight

in the at the

Respondent to receive personal data stocks and man

provide him with excerpts and copies of the data and file collection in the course of this

would have asked, the following is to be countered to her.

The GDPR is a subsidiarity regulation according to § 44 Para. 5 DSG in the area of application

of the 3rd main part of the DSG (which does not apply in this case) foreign.

From this it can be deduced that now, by means of a request for information, in principle also

Information about the content of documents and file components can be requested (cf.

also the decision of April 18, 2019, GZ DSB-D122.913/0001-DSB/2019), if therein

personal data of the person concerned are included and the factual

Scope of application of the GDPR is opened (cf. Art. 4 para. 1 leg. cit).

Furthermore, information pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR has in any case information about the person concerned

person processed personal data ("master data") and the information

in accordance with Article 15(1) lit. a - h (“metadata”), which the complainant probably

was also not brought to the attention of the person by appearing at the appointment for inspection of files

would be.

According to Art. 12 Para. 1, a person responsible has to take appropriate measures in order to

data subject all information pursuant to Art. 13 and 14 and all communications pursuant

Art. 15 to 22 and Art. 34 GDPR, which relate to the processing, in more detail,

transparent, understandable and easily accessible form in a clear and simple way

to transmit language.

According to Art. 12 Para. 3 GDPR, this information is immediate, but in any case

to be made available within one month of the request.

In any case, the Respondent did not respond adequately to the request for information

reacted and was to be instructed to give the complainant one of the Art. 15 DSGVO

to provide relevant information.

Point 2 is based on Article 58 (2) (c) GDPR. The restriction according to § 24

Para. 5 DSG must be disregarded because it is not covered by Art. 58 GDPR

(cf. BVwG of May 28, 2020, GZ W211 221 6385-1).

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.
