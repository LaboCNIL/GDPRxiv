Para. 1 and 2 Court Organization Act - GOG, RGBl. 217/1896 as amended; Art. 82 and

REASON

A. Submissions of the parties and course of the proceedings

With a procedural submission dated December 18, 2018, ho. arrived at

December 19, 2018, the complainant complained that the

Respondent in the context of the decision documentation of his judgments in

Federal Legal Information System (RIS) insufficient anonymization

made and thereby violated his right to secrecy. When

The Respondent was named the Supreme Court (OGH), which

Complaint specified decision.

B. In legal terms it follows that:

According to Art. 55 Para. 3 GDPR, the supervisory authorities are not responsible for the supervision of the

Processing carried out by courts in the course of their judicial activities

responsible.

According to recital 20 of the GDPR, this serves the independence of the judiciary in the exercise

their judicial duties, including their passing of resolutions. With oversight

the data processing operations should be carried out by special bodies in the judicial system

Member States can be entrusted.

The GDPR itself does not expressly state what judicial activity a

constitutes judicial activity.

According to a well-established opinion in the literature, matters that fall under the

administration of justice bound by instructions, does not come under the concept of

"judicial activity" (cf. Schmidl in more detail in

Gantschacher/Jelinek/Schmidl/Spanberger, comment on data protection

Basic Regulation1 [2017] Art. 55 Note 3; Nguyen in Gola (ed.), Privacy

Basic Ordinance [2017] Art. 55 para. 13; Selmayr in Ehmann/Selmayr (eds.), DS-GVO

[2017] Art. 55 para. 12ff).

According to the case law of the data protection authority, an activity of a court lies in

The scope of judicial activity when a judge is engaged in the exercise of judicial functions

Office is located or a judge or a public prosecutor otherwise in the care of

transferred official business is free from instructions (cf. the notices of

October 16, 2018, GZ DSB-D123.461/0004-DSB/2018, as well as from January 22, 2019,

GZ DSB-D123.848/0001-DSB/2019).

As far as the legal documentation by the OGH is concerned, § 15 OGHG regulates the following

on:

The federal decision documentation (RIS) contains names, addresses and

if necessary, also other place and area names that allow conclusions to be drawn

allow the case in question, by letters, numbers or abbreviations so

anonymized so that the traceability of the decision is not lost.

The senate must make these arrangements when passing the resolution.

As the designated legal act in the independent exercise of judicial office

came about, a complaint to the data protection authority is not permissible.

Legal protection in the event of alleged violations of the right to secrecy by a

Court in the context of judicial activity is based on §§ 83 ff GOG.

The appeal was therefore dismissed in accordance with the verdict
