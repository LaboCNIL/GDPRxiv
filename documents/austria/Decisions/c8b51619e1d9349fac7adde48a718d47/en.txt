III.

Legally it follows:

 
III.1. According to § 30 paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 in conjunction with § 62 paragraph 3 DSG, the data protection authority
Impose fines or other administrative penalties on a legal person if

III.5. According to Section 45 (1) last sentence of the VStG, the authority can inform the accused

Regarding point 1:
 
III.6. According to § 50d paragraph 1 DSG 2000, a person responsible for video surveillance has this
suitable to mark. In any case, the person responsible has been clearly identified from the marking
to emerge, unless this is clear to the persons concerned according to the circumstances of the

Failure to fulfill this obligation constitutes a violation of Section 50d (1) DSG 2000 or Section 13 (5) DSG

Regarding point 2:
 
III.7. Based on the period between May 25, 2018 (entry into force of the GDPR and the
associated facts) and 04.11.2018 covered the recording area of
physical cameras public space and was thus not limited to areas
which are at the exclusive disposal of the person responsible; the
Image processing was therefore not appropriate for the purpose of the processing and not to the
necessary amount limited. Before 05/25/2018, the DSG 2000 did not have its own
Facts intended for filming public space.
 
Consequently, the operation of image recording in the period from 05/25/2018 to 11/04/2018 violates
against the principles standardized in Art. 5 GDPR, especially since the person responsible for
Achieving the purpose it pursues - namely the preventive protection of people

Refrain from criminal proceedings and order the cessation if the meaning of the criminal law
protected legal interest and the intensity of its impairment by the act and the
fault of the accused is low.
 
IV.2. Instead of ordering the cessation, the authority can, in the case of Z 4
issue a warning with reference to the illegality of his behavior,
if this appears necessary to prevent him from committing criminal acts of the same kind
to hold
 
IV.3. Referring to the statements made above under point II. or the above
under item III.6. and III.7. resulting legal considerations, as well as the previous ones
data protection integrity of the accused goes to the recognizing authority
assuming that it was indeed a one-off misconduct; this, especially
the accused the illegal condition by removing the camera (at the latest on
02.12.2018) subsequently eliminated.
 
It was therefore possible to refrain from imposing a fine. At the same time will
but on the unlawfulness of the lawful behavior for the crime period up to November 4th, 2018
pointed out to the accused of other criminal acts of the same kind
to hold
