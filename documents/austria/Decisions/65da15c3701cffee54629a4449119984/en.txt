had been known. Also, neither would a joint appearance with a

Union member, another association with the union such a one

imply belonging. It should also be noted that the complainant in

Unions according to § 36 Abs. 2 ArbVG.

Evidence assessment: The findings made are based on the opinion of the

Respondent of October 2, 2018 together with the documents submitted therein (in particular

D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. On the scope of protection of § 1 Para. 1 DSG

a) Basics

According to § 1 Para. 1 DSG, everyone has the right to confidentiality of the data concerning him

personal data, insofar as there is a legitimate interest in it. The existence

such an interest is excluded if data as a result of their general

availability or due to their lack of traceability to the person concerned

secrecy claim are not accessible.

b) On "generally available data"

According to the established Rsp of the data protection authority, the very general assumption of the

absence

an injury

confidentiality interests worthy of protection

for

legitimately published data not compliant with the provisions of the GDPR,

why the restriction for "generally available data" standardized in § 1 para. 1 DSG

has to remain unapplied (cf. the notification of January 15, 2019, GZ DSB-

D123.527/0004-DSB/2018 with regard to § 27 para. 1 ÄrzteG 1998 and the decision of

October 31, 2018, GZ DSB-D123.076/0003-DSB/2018 mwN and the notice of

April 23, 2019, GZ DSB-D123.626/0006-DSB/2018).

c) On the "traceability of the data"

further

relate

the

(Surname,

trade union membership) indisputably to the complainant.

d) intermediate result

The scope of protection of § 1 Para. 1 DSG is therefore open in principle.

2. Regarding the restrictions according to § 1 Para. 2 DSG

Restrictions on the right to secrecy are then in accordance with Section 1 (2) DSG

permissible if personal data is in the vital interest of the person concerned

be used, the data subject has given his consent, if a qualified

legal basis for use exists, or if use by

overriding legitimate interests of a third party is justified.

The GDPR and in particular the principles enshrined therein are to interpret the

Right to secrecy (cf. the decision of the DSB of October 31, 2018,

GZ DSB-D123.076/0003-DSB/2018).

The use of data in question is not in the vital interest of the

Complainant and a consent as well as a legal obligation is also

little before.

However, legitimate interests of a third party come into question.

3. Weighing of Interests

a) General

First

It should be noted that union membership is one of the “particularly

data worthy of protection" according to § 1 Para. 2 second sentence DSG counts (cf. Art. 9 Para. 1 DSGVO).

b) Re Article 9 (2) (e) GDPR

If the Respondent relies on Article 9(2)(e) GDPR in this context

is based, it should first be noted that the exceptional circumstances of Art. 9 Para. 2 DSGVO

are in principle to be interpreted narrowly and the facts of the "obvious own

Publication" within the meaning of lit. e leg. cit. an act of will of the person concerned

requires. In case of doubt, no own publication will be accepted, rather this must be done

be proven by the person responsible (Kastelitz/Hötzendorfer/Tschohl in Knyrim, DatKomm

Art 9 GDPR, margin nos. 41-42).

According to the data protection authority, such proof was not provided:

Neither the fact that the complainant publicly communicated with members of the

trade union photographed, nor her work as a works council member and that

coherent cooperation with the union, can as a separate act of will to

publication will be assessed.

Apart from that, it should also be pointed out that the group of addressees is extremely wide

addressed by the Respondent in its letter of July 27, 2018. It is of it

it can be assumed that this also includes people who are union members

the complainant was not "obviously known".

This means that the prohibition principle of Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR does not apply

Basis of Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. e leg. cit. was repealed.

c) Re Article 9 (2) (f) GDPR

The Respondent considers the "assertion, exercise

or defense of legal claims or where the courts are acting in their

judicial activity” within the meaning of Article 9 (2) (f) GDPR.

In this regard, it should be noted that the concept of “legal entitlement” is fundamentally broad

is to be interpreted and this covers both judicial and extrajudicial claims. Decisive

is, however, that there is a legal conflict (cf. the judgment of the Supreme Court of July 24, 2019,

6 Ob 45/19i, referring to the ship in Ehmann/Selmayr, Art. 9 GDPR margin no. 48).

In the present case, the Respondent merely expressed fears that

claims for damages arise in the future, but there are no concrete legal claims

before and were also not claimed.

Furthermore, it should be pointed out that in this context it is probably also due to the

Requirement of notification of union membership would fail to

to be able to ward off or defend such legal claims:

In the opinion of the data protection authority, it is not clear why it is necessary for the defence

from

(unspecified) legal claims would be required which

information of

trade union membership of the complainant to a larger group of addressees

To make available.

Therefore, neither the existence of a legal claim nor the necessity can be affirmed

be, which is why a justification according to Art. 9 Para. 2 lit f GDPR is out of the question

comes.

Other legitimate interests are not apparent to the data protection authority.

4. Result

As a result, it can be stated that the principle of prohibition according to Art. 9 Para. 1 DSGVO for lack

Permission according to Art. 9 Para. 2 leg. cit. was not repealed and neither

entitled

Interests of the Respondent in the objectively relevant

data processing are available.

The disclosure of the complainant's trade union membership in the communication of the

Respondent of July 27, 2018 was therefore unlawful.

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.
