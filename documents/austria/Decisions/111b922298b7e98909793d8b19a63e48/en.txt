Furthermore, the subject video surveillance system captures the very personal
Living area of roommates, which when entering and leaving their apartments

official number plates of parked cars are clearly recognizable.
 
6. The video surveillance system in question is not suitably marked.
 
7. The cameras in question have been in operation since at least May 15, 2018. To this
At the time, the city council of N***stadt (by means of an e-mail from those affected) was informed by the
Cameras notified.
 
8. In the course of the ggst. Proceedings by RSa letter issued request for
Justification from November 5th, 2018 was according to the return receipt of the Austrian Post AG - after
a delivery attempt on 14.11.2018 - from 15.11.2018 at the post office (****) for collection

https://www.statistics.at/web_de/statistics/people_und_society/social/persons-
income/net monthly income/057212.html, last accessed on December 17, 2018.

 
II.

The determinations are made on the basis of the following assessment of evidence:



1. The data protection authority puts the content of the by - until 24.05.2018 on the merits
responsible - mayor of the city of N***stadt transmitted administrative offense together
Picture supplements, the information on the return receipt from Österreichische Post AG, through official channels
Queries in the central register and land register as well as inspection of the income report
of the Federal Institute Statistics Austria based their factual findings.

 

2. The findings are more closely based on the credible and substantiated
Submission of the private advertiser, which is also linked on the Internet by a user of a social
Medium with the name of the accused published photographs are substantiated
could (cf. e-mails from May 15, 2018, May 17, 2018 and June 14, 2018); the within the
The allegation raised by the request for justification remained entirely unaffected by the accused
undisputed, the deadline for justification expired unused and the accused is also the
Missed hearing date before the data protection authority on October 30, 2018 (10:00 a.m.).
In addition, the data protection authority also reached up to the issuance of the
sent no justifying arguments.

 

3. On the part of the data protection authority, based on general life experience, it is considered
predominantly considered likely that the cameras at issue
have not been taken out of service in the meantime; rather the data protection authority goes
from a permanent establishment of the same.
 

III.

Legally it follows:

 
Regarding administrative criminal liability:
 
1. On the legal situation:
 
Article 83 paragraph 5 lit
6 GDPR fines of up to 20,000,000 euros or in the case of a company of up to
4% of its total worldwide annual sales for the previous financial year
may be imposed, depending on which of the amounts is higher.
 
Pursuant to § 62 Para. 1 Z 4 DSG, anyone who
Image processing contrary to the provisions of the 3rd section of the 1st main part (§§ 12
and 13 DSG).
 
According to § 69 paragraph 5 DSG are violations of the DSG 2000, which at the time of entry into force
of the DSG have not yet been made pending, according to the legal situation after the entry into force of the
assess DSG. A criminal offense that occurred before the DSG came into force
is to be assessed according to the legal situation that affects the perpetrator in its overall effect
is cheaper; this also applies to the appeal proceedings.
 
Because the subject conduct commenced prior to May 25, 2018 – the Effective Date
of the DSG - lies, the possible maximum penalties according to § 62 Abs. 1 Z 4 DSG above those according to § 52
Para. 2 DSG 2000, come with regard to the amount of the penalty - insofar as there are violations of the
DSG 2000 or the DSG concerns - the provisions of the DSG 2000 apply.
 
2. As stated above, the Data Protection Authority has the subject
Administrative penal proceedings according to § 42 para. 1 no. 2 VStG without hearing the accused
accomplished.
 
Regarding point 1:
 
3. In the present case lies with the operation of the cameras, starting from the door and
Window area in Top *7 of the multi-party residential complex that is the subject of the proceedings
located apartment of the accused, undisputedly a photo in the sense of § 12 para. 1 DSG

before. The GDPR defines the term processing in Art. 4 Z 2 GDPR by listing
a number of possible uses. Included are the collection, the
Capture, organization, ordering, storage, adaptation or modification,
reading, retrieval, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination
or any other form of providing, matching or linking that
restriction, deletion or destruction.
 
Through the collection, storage and transmission (publication) of the subject matter
Image data is the material scope of Art. 2 GDPR.
 
In any case, the recorded image data constitute personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 1
GDPR and is also one due to the storage and transmission of the same
Processing within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 2 DSGVO given. The accused is responsible for
to qualify the present data processing iSd Art 4 Z 7 DSGVO.
 
4. Art. 5 GDPR sets out the principles for the processing of personal data and
determines its paragraph 1 lit. a that personal data in a lawful manner, according to
processed in good faith and in a manner that is comprehensible to the data subject
(“lawfulness, fair processing, transparency”); lit. c
leg.cit. establishes as a further principle that all processing is appropriate and appropriate for the purpose
be substantial and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of the processing
("Data Minimization").

 

According to Article 6 GDPR, processing is only lawful if at least one of the
the following conditions are met:

 
a) the data subject has given their consent to the processing of data concerning them
personal data given for one or more specific purposes;
b) the processing is for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party
person is, or necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures,
which are made at the request of the data subject;
c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation imposed by the
Controller is subject to;
d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject
protect any person or other natural person;
e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task that is
is in the public interest or in the exercise of public authority which
responsible has been transferred.
f) the processing is to protect the legitimate interests of the person responsible
or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and
Fundamental freedoms of the data subject, the protection of personal data
require, especially when the data subject is
a child acts.
 

Recital 47 leads, among other things, to the lawfulness of processing operations
explanatory that this is due to the legitimate interests of a person responsible, also one
Controller to whom the personal data may be disclosed, or one
Third parties may be justified, provided that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of
data subject do not outweigh; including the reasonable expectations of those concerned
person based on their relationship with the controller. A
legitimate interest could exist, for example, if a relevant and
there is an appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller,
e.g. B. if the data subject is a customer of the controller or in its service
stands.

 

In any case, the existence of a legitimate interest would be particularly careful
to be weighed up, whereby it must also be checked whether a data subject was a data subject at the time of the collection
of the personal data and given the circumstances in which it occurs,
can reasonably foresee that there may be processing for this purpose
will take place. Especially when personal data is processed in situations
where a data subject is reasonably unrelated to further processing
must be taken into account, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could be the interest
of the person responsible prevail.
 
5. The recording range of the cameras in question covers - as stated under item I. -
located in front of the residential complex, intended for general use by all residents
Areas such as courtyard, garden and car parking areas and parts of a neighboring property.
 
6. Since neither the accused's neighbors nor those otherwise from the recording area of the
physical cameras recorded persons (e.g. visitors of residents),
reasonably expect to be admitted, the operation violates the
Image recording against the principles of purpose limitation standardized in Art. 5 and
data minimization.
 
7. A legal basis for the lawfulness of the data processing within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1
DSGVO is not apparent and was not brought forward by the accused. In particular
is used by the data protection authority with regard to the spatial coverage of the
objective image recording on the part of the person responsible no legitimate interest in
Image acquisition operation detected. Rather, in the present case, the
(Fundamentally) protected rights to secrecy and protection of private and
Family life of the neighbors and other affected persons within the meaning of § 1 DSG or Art. 7 GRC and
Art. 8 EMRK any interest in the operation of the subject image recording.
 
Regarding point 2:
 
7. The operation of video surveillance, starting from an apartment door, one in one
Multi-party apartment located apartment, represents a photo in the sense of § 12 para. 1 DSG:
 
The regulation of § 12 DSG is aimed at basically all image recordings
Subject those responsible for the private sphere to this provision, provided that these
are not already excluded from the scope of Art. 2 Para. 2 lit. c GDPR and
neither do other laws specifically provide for this (cf.
Bresich/Dopplinger/Dörnhöfer/Kunnert/Riedl, DSG, § 12, p. 134).
 
§ 12 para. 1 DSG defines under an image recording within the meaning of Section 3 of the DSG
through the use of technical equipment for image processing
Findings of events in public or non-public space to private
purposes.
 
The term "event" should be understood further. In particular, a mobile
Video recording to be captured. In this sense, the term "image recording" should also be broad
be interpreted and also capture mere records, although a specific object
or targeting a specific person, but not aimed at "surveillance".
(Bresich/Dopplinger/Dörnhöfer/Kunnert/Riedl, DSG, § 12, p. 134).
 
8. According to § 12 Para. 4 Z 1 DSG, taking a picture without the express consent of the
affected person whose highly personal area of life is being interfered with is inadmissible.
Places that can be attributed to the most personal area of life are e.g. private apartments,
Changing or toilet cubicles (cf. Pollirer/Weiss/Knyrim/Haidinger, Data Protection Act, § 12,
note 12).
 

9. The Supreme Court has ruled that private photography,
continuous undesired surveillance and prosecutions constitute a violation of the provisions of Art. 8
ECHR-protected personality right to respect for the private sphere and the
represent a person's secret sphere; protecting a tenant's privacy
Such measures do not end at the inner apartment door; it is quite a
legitimate interest in granting that entering or leaving an apartment
not continuously monitored and recorded by the tenant, his roommates or guests
will; it is not a question of whether such surveillance is also recorded
because it is already a serious violation of privacy (sphere of secrecy)
represents when a person concerned is identified by the type of attachment and the external appearance
feels exposed to constant monitoring pressure (cf. Supreme Court of December 17, 2013, 5 Ob
69/13b).
 
10. From this it can be deduced for the present procedure that the highly personal
Living area according to § 12 Abs. 4 Z 1 DSG basically also the outside of an apartment door
includes, because it covers entering and leaving the home of the person concerned
(see also the decision of the data protection authority of August 22, 2014,
GZ DSB-D215.463/0006-DSB/2014).
 
11. From the recording area of the camera installed in the apartment door to Top No. *7 - how
above under item I.4. found - also the hallway area in front of the same, which leads to further,
residential units located within the multi-party residential complex. Since to
highly personal area of life include rooms, to which only a limited der/dem
Authorized known group of people has access, e.g. a private apartment, is the
image processing that is the subject of the proceedings does not justify a weighing of interests
accessible. Such image processing would only be permissible with the express
Consent of the person concerned, which does not exist.
 
Regarding point 3:
 
12. Pursuant to § 13 Para. 5 DSG, the person responsible for taking a picture must appropriately record it
mark. In any case, the person responsible has been clearly identified from the marking
to emerge, unless this is clear to the persons concerned according to the circumstances of the
If already known. The labeling must be done locally in such a way that everyone potentially
Affected person who approaches a monitored object, if possible has the possibility of
Avoid video surveillance. A similar arrangement provided for § 50d Abs. 1 DSG 2000.
 
13. This is not possible in the present case, as there are no signs outside or
attached to the access areas of the residential complex and in the hallway in front of Top No. *7
are.
 
14. It follows that the failure to comply with that obligation in the present case is contrary to
§ 13 para. 5 in conjunction with § 62 para. 1 no. 4 DSG and, for the period before May 25, 2018, against § 52
Para. 2 Z 4 in conjunction with § 50d DSG 2000.
 
15. In application of the requirements and obligations of §§ 12 f DSG to the present
Facts, the recognizing authority comes to the conclusion that the person responsible
Procedural image recording exclusively in compliance with the
Prerequisites for admissibility and proportionality of § 12 DSG, Art. 5 and 6
GDPR and in compliance with the requirements in § 12 Para. 4 Z 1 and the obligation
according to § 13 paragraph 5 DSG.
 
16. Against the background of the facts established as proven, the accused as
Responsible according to Art. 4 Z 7 DSGVO therefore the objective side of the facts against him
administrative violation of Art. 83 Para. 5 lit. a GDPR and § 62 Para. 1 Z 4
DSG or § 52 Para. 2 Z 4 DSG 2000.
 

17. In the case of administrative offences, the crime picture of which is a mere violation of a
prohibition or non-compliance with a commandment and that no damage has occurred
or a danger (disobedience offenses) - if not exclusively intentional
is required - criminal liability assumed if the perpetrator is not credible within the meaning of Section 5 (1) VStG
makes sure that he is not at fault for the violation of the administrative regulation (cf. VwGH,
18.6.1990, 91/09/0132). There is a presumption of fault from the outset (e.g.
Administrative Court, June 18, 1999, 89/10/0221). It is up to the accused to make it credible that
it was impossible for him to comply with the administrative regulations through no fault of his own. To the
Credibility of lack of fault requires the explanation that the accused
has taken measures which, under the foreseeable circumstances, ensure compliance with the
legal regulations had reason to expect.
 
18. On the part of the accused, it was not argued that compliance with the
Provisions of the GDPR and §§ 12 and 13 DSG or §§ 50a ff DSG 2000 do not
would have been possible.
 

IV

The following should be noted for sentencing:

 
1. According to Section 19 (1) of the VStG, the basis for assessing the penalty is the meaning
of the legal interest protected by criminal law and the intensity of its impairment by the
Did. Moreover, according to the purpose of the threat of punishment, these are the ones that come into consideration
Reasons for aggravation and mitigation, insofar as they do not already determine the threat of punishment,
weigh against each other. Particular attention should be paid to the degree of culpability
to take. Taking into account the peculiarity of administrative criminal law, §§ 32 to 35
apply the Criminal Code accordingly. The income and assets and any
The accused's duty of care must be taken into account when assessing fines.
 
In this regard, all circumstances of Art 83 Para. 2 are within the scope of the GDPR
GDPR must be taken into account when determining the penalty. In the present case, they could
Income and financial circumstances as well as any due diligence obligations – in the absence of
Participation of the accused - are not taken into account.
 
The authority therefore had to assess the income and financial situation
to proceed (cf. Administrative Court of April 27, 2000, 98/10/0003).
 
In this case, the accused has to attribute it to his failure to cooperate
the authority about this assessment to the detriment of the accused circumstances
have disregarded, which without his participation the authority is not aware of
(cf. Administrative Court of January 31, 2012, 2009/05/0123).
 
Using the data provided by the Federal Institute Statistics Austria – most recently for the reporting year
2016 – published values in terms of average monthly net income
Employed men of € 1,883.00 was determined by the data protection authority from
an average monthly net income of the accused of approx
€ 1,800 assumed.
 
2. The provisions of §§ 12 f DSG and Art. 5 and 6 DSGVO aim to
fundamentally protected legal positions of those affected from interference by public or
to protect images used for private purposes in non-public spaces that do not
meet the requirements with regard to their admissibility and proportionality.
The prohibition established with § 12 para. 4 Z 1 DSG prohibits the responsible person
Image recording explicitly, without the express consent of the person concerned
to create their most personal areas of life. The regulation of § 13 Abs. 5 DSG
should enable those affected to take (undesirable) pictures if possible
avoid and, if necessary, determine who is responsible for taking the picture.
 

3. In the specific case, when determining the penalty, it was to be taken into account that the
detected improper operation of the image acquisition is potentially suitable, a large number of
Affected, here: Neighbors of the accused or neighbors of the housing complex and users
of general parts of the residential complex and public traffic areas in which
fundamentally protected rights - in particular in their right to secrecy within the meaning of § 1
DSG and their right to respect for private and family life iSd Art 7 GRC or Art 8
ECHR - to violate. That the neighbors improve their quality of life through constant observation
considered restricted by the accused, their e-mail correspondence with the
Magistrate of the city of N***stadt.
 
4. The violation in question is due to the high degree of wrongfulness and due to the
The fact that it is a systematic violation of the obligation of the
Responsible acts as difficult to assess. Finally, through several cameras in the
Exterior of the apartment in Top No. *7 systematically taking pictures of general
areas of the residential complex, as well as from the highly personal area of life
data subject created; the recordings were also (at least in part) also on the Internet
published and thus made accessible to an indefinite group of addressees.
 
5. This was therefore to be considered as an aggravating factor, with the intensity of the intervention increasing
through the operation of an inadmissible and disproportionate image processing, which is here
covers both public space and the highly personal area of life,
in the present case on the penalties assigned separately for the individual points in the verdict - in
relation to one another – has been accordingly reflected. A refrain from imposition
is therefore not considered. Infringement duration – picture taking is like
determined to have been in operation for at least several months – was also considered aggravating too
evaluate.
 
6. Therefore and to protect the accused from further criminal acts of the same kind
held, the imposition of a penalty in the specific case was necessary. The need for
Special prevention also results from the fact that the accused
has not yet taken the cameras that are the subject of the proceedings out of operation.
 
7. Regarding the degree of culpability or the degree of culpability of the person responsible
In any case, negligent behavior was assumed.
Negligent behavior is considered neither mitigating nor aggravating.
 
8. As a mitigating factor, the fact that no relevant
reservations have been made.
