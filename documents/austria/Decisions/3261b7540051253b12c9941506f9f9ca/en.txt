Right to confidentiality as follows:

1. The appeal is upheld and it is established that the Respondent

violated the complainant's right to secrecy by

their personal data, namely first name, last name and telephone number

for contact tracing

Suspected cases of COVID-19 (Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance), OJ No. 41/2020.

REASON

A. Submissions of the parties and course of the proceedings

1. With the procedural submission dated October 5, 2020, the complainant submitted that

Respondent raises about their processor when entering their business premises in 1 ** 0

Vienna, Y***straße *, iSd Wiener Contact-Tracing regulation the personal data first name,

Last name, phone, email (optional) and table number.

In addition, the Respondent informs that they use this data to protect "from

Life and health of our employees and our guests in connection with the occurrence

of the coronavirus

or.

of the COVID-19 epidemic"

such as

to the

"Support

the

District administrative authority when identifying contact persons in the event of an infection"

raise In the reply to the information, on the other hand, the respondent supported the processing

the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance, which probably means processing in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. c

GDPR is meant. The Respondent concludes the contract from the provision of the

dependent on personal data.

As a result, the complainant sees himself in his fundamental right to data protection in accordance with Section 1 (1).

DSG infringed because the Respondent received the above-mentioned personal data

unlawful because without a legal basis within the meaning of Art. 6 GDPR.

The complaint was accompanied by a request for information and the information provided by the respondent in

copy enclosed.

2. With completion of October 14, 2020, GZ: 2020-0.647.953, the data protection authority requested the

Respondent to comment.

3. With a submission dated October 27, 2020, the Respondent replied and argued that the

On October 2, 2020, the complainant found the restaurant operated by the respondent

in Y***strasse *, 1**0 Vienna. According to the legal requirements of the Wiener Contact

The online registration used by the complainant is carried out using a QR code, which is

Below this registration mask you will find the data protection declaration in accordance with Art. 13 GDPR.

The data protection declaration is also confirmed accordingly by the user before sending his data.

As already stated in the data protection declaration itself, guests are not obliged to keep their

it is also made clear that if you refuse to provide your contact details, you will be denied access to the

Restaurant can be refused. As the information provided by the Respondent of October 5, 2020

it can be inferred that the complainant registered on October 2, 2020 at 12:39:17 p.m

and the following data announced, namely name: Uwe A*** and telephone: 066**7**3*. As before

stated in the information of October 5, 2020, the Respondent collects from the guests

voluntarily disclosed data based on the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance

for the

intended period of 4 weeks in which they are kept safe and then deleted

would. Processing of the data for purposes other than fulfilling the legal obligation

according to the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance expressly does not take place.

The processing purposes are stated in the data protection declaration made available to the guests

"Protection of the life and health of our employees and our guests in connection with the

Occurrence of the coronavirus or the COVID-19 epidemic”

such as

"Support of

District administrative authority in tracing contact persons in the event of an

case of infection".

In the information provided by the Respondent to the Complainant on October 5, 2020

It was stated that the guest data collected was based on Wiener Contact-Tracing

regulation are processed.

In addition, the complainant alleges that the respondent makes the conclusion of the contract

dependent on the provision of the personal data and that the data processing without

Legal basis according to Art. 6 DSGVO and would therefore be unlawful.

For whatever reason, the complaint leaves many facts and circumstances unmentioned,

based on a legally incorrect assessment and was not justified. The processing of

voluntarily stated by the guests and subsequently by the Respondent

Responsible processed data takes place lawfully on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c DSGVO,

namely to fulfill their legal obligations under the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance.

The data processing purposes stated in the data protection declaration are obvious

merely a description of the purposes of the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance. Already in § 1

Paragraph 1 of the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance is made clear why, in the opinion of the

legislature of such a (for restaurateurs associated with a considerable effort)

Regulation required: “To prevent the spread of COVID-19, in the event that it occurs

a suspected case of COVID-19 from the following information at the request of

district administrative authority: […]”.

In addition, it is already made clear in the data protection declaration under point 3 that the

Data are processed on the basis of the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance. Neither give it to him

than those required to meet the requirements of the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance. Out

what is the motivation for the complainant to disregard all of this in his complaint,

stay open.

Likewise, it is not comprehensible on what factual or legal basis

Complainant claim the conclusion of the contract

(meaning probably the purchase of

Food/drinks at the Respondent) would depend on the provision of the personal

Data dependent: Already in the data protection declaration itself, under point 2, last sentence,

clarified that the disclosure of any data is voluntary. The Respondent is neither

legally obliged to make access dependent on the disclosure of any data

they otherwise have an interest in it. It is also significant that the complainant himself is only a part

provided the data provided in the (online) form, but apparently neither allowed him access

nor the "conclusion of the contract" had been denied. The complaint therefore turns out to be

unfounded.

3. With completion of November 3, 2020, GZ: 2020-0.701.142, the data protection authority admitted that

Complainant heard a party.

4. The applicant stated in his hearing of the parties on November 10, 2020 that

his complaint, unlike that of the respondent in its statement of

27 October 2020, neither against a violation of the information obligation within the meaning of Art. 13 DSGVO

judge, nor does the complainant base a complaint on the fact of the conditionality of

Data collection and conclusion of contract.

As stated unequivocally in the complaint of October 5, 2020, the

Complainant violated his basic right to data protection according to § 1 Para. 1 DSG,

that the Respondent unlawfully used the data categories first name, last name and telephone

process.

In its statement, the Respondent submitted several times that the Complainant

I have voluntarily provided the data categories that are the subject of the proceedings. I have this as proof

a bundle of photos enclosed, from which it should apparently be possible to conclude that no registration

is necessary in order to be able to consume food in the restaurant. In fact, of course, there is

a forced situation to provide the data categories that are the subject of the proceedings. This on the one hand

due to the graphic preparation of a display, which is primarily aimed at - by the broad public

Reporting - generally recognized as mandatory "COVID-19 guest registration"

refer. Furthermore, the arguments of the Respondent should be countered that already through

a passage in the data protection information submitted by the respondent as an attachment, where

it says: "[...] the refusal to make it available cannot grant access to the restaurant

become”, there can be no question of a voluntary nature.

Furthermore, the Respondent stated in this very point of the statement that these as

responsible for data protection law the data categories that are the subject of the procedure

would be processed because the processing is to fulfill a legal obligation (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c

GDPR) to which the Respondent is subject would be required. This legal

Obligation would arise (not determined in detail by the Respondent) from the Wiener

Derive contact tracing regulation.

In fact, however, the said regulation does not oblige the respondent to

systematic collection of the data categories that are the subject of the proceedings. Specifically it means

with regard to catering establishments that these - based on § 5 Para. 3 EpiG - "in the event

the occurrence of a suspected case [...] at the request of the district administrative authority" first name,

"To transmit" the name, phone number, email address and table number of customers

to have. Alone the reference to § 5 para. 3 EpiG, which is merely an obligation to provide information

regulate, but also the clear wording of the regulation text, made it clear that the

Respondent under the regulation no legal obligation to collect the

Anticipatory obedience by the Respondent - equivalent to data retention -

In any case, it is not possible to indiscriminately collect personal data from your customers

based on Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR.

B. Subject of Complaint

of the complainant, namely first name, last name, telephone number, e-mail address and

The Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance reads in part:

 

On the basis of Section 5 (3) Epidemics Act 1950, Federal Law Gazette No. 186/1950 as amended in Federal Law Gazette I No. 103/2020

prescribed:

Basis.

Restrictions of Section 1 Paragraph 1 DSG result from Paragraph 2 leg. cit., but not from Art. 6 Paragraph 1

GDPR. However, the GDPR and in particular the principles enshrined in it are after

In any case, the opinion of the data protection authority on the interpretation of the right to secrecy

should be taken into account and used accordingly (cf. the notification of October 31, 2018,

GZ: DSB--D123.076/0003-DSB/2018).

2. In the matter

2.1. On the qualification of the complainant's personal data and the legal basis

the data processing in the present case

Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR finally defines special categories of personal data

("sensitive data"). Insofar as this is relevant in the present case, this also includes health data. the

Processing of these data categories is exclusively based on Art. 9 Para. 2 GDPR

concluding reasons for exception are permitted.

According to Art. 4 Z 15 GDPR, health data is “personal data relating to the

physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of

Health services, obtain and from which information about their health status

emerge."

In the light of Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR, health data is undoubtedly special

data worthy of protection, whereby the term in the sense of Rsp. of the ECJ is to be interpreted broadly (cf. on Art. 8

Paragraph 1 of Directive 95/46, the judgment of the ECJ of November 6, 2003, C-101/01, margin no. 50). are recorded

according to Art. 4 Z 15 GDPR in combination with recital 35 second sentence GDPR also numbers,

In its established case law, the Data Protection Authority maintains that from health data

from the

2019,

GZ: DSB-D123.526/0001-DSB/2019).

In the case of the complainant's data processed by the respondent (first and

surname, telephone number) is undoubtedly his personal data.

It is questionable whether they are also - under the circumstances of the present case - to

health data.

According to the case law of the data protection authorities, they are assigned to a person

Identification numbers (such as the social security number) do not represent a health date if they

used as a mere identifier and independent of a health context (cf.

most recently the notification of November 5, 2020, GZ: 2020-0.714.215 [Editor's note: im

Original text of the notification due to an editorial error GZ: 2021-0.041.702]).

The object of the complaint was the data of the complainant - as well as the

Respondent expressly emphasizes - exclusively for the purpose of "protecting life and

Health of [the] employees and [the] guests [of the Respondent] in connection with the

Occurrence of the coronavirus or the COVID-19 epidemic” and for the purpose of “supporting the

District administrative authority in tracing contact persons in the event of an

case of infection”.

It is clear from this that the data collection was carried out in a purely health context and that the

collected data should also be used exclusively in such a way, namely, on the one hand, to

to protect others and, on the other hand, to provide this data to the district administrative authority in case of need

as a health authority according to the EpiG.

Consequently, the data processed about the complainant, namely his first and last name

as well as his telephone number, which, detached from the present context, does not contain any data within the meaning of Art. 9

Para. 1 GDPR would represent, in the case at issue as health data and

to qualify as a special category of personal data.

The lawfulness of the processing is therefore based on Article 9 (2) GDPR.

2.2. On the lawfulness of data processing

a) To be voluntary

i) The Respondent bases its submissions on, among other things, those of the Complainant

given voluntary consent to data processing.

The processing of health data is permitted according to Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR if the

data subject has expressly consented to the processing of their personal data.

The complainant countered that with regard to the provision of his

Data cannot be said to be voluntary, since when collecting his data in

would have been in a forced situation. On the one hand because of the entrance area of the business premises

situated reference to the COVID-19 guest registration and in the data protection declaration of the

passage contained by the Respondent, according to which, if the data is refused,

access to the restaurant can be denied.

ii) In the opinion of the Data Protection Authority, the arguments of the Respondent are already working

not because, according to the case law of the ECJ, consent is an active and

requires an unmistakable ("without any doubt") act of will on the part of the person concerned (cf.

most recently the judgment of November 11, 2020, C-61/19 with further references). This applies all the more to the processing of

Health data, because Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR - unlike Art. 6 (1) (a) - an express

consent required.

The Respondent was not able to prove such a thing, although she had the duty

(see Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. a and Para. 2 in conjunction with Art. 7 and 9 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR).

In addition, a strict standard must be applied to consent. So one has

Consent to be given voluntarily and must not be linked to the performance of a contract, although

consent is not required to fulfill this contract. Consent is involuntary

if a disadvantage is to be expected if consent is not given (cf. the decision of

April 16, 2019, GZ: DSB-D213.679/0003-DSB/2018, and again the judgment of the ECJ of

11/11/2020).

After the refusal to make it available, as stated by the Respondent itself

submitted, access to the business premises - with reference to the domiciliary rights - be refused

can and this fact is pointed out in the data protection declaration, is from the point of view of one

objective average customers can clearly expect a disadvantage if they do not give their consent

been.

Voluntariness also requires that in the event of non-consent to data processing

a reasonable alternative is available to the person concerned (cf. the decision of

November 30, 2018, GZ: DSB-D122.931/0003-DSB/2018).

This is also to be denied in the present case, because other establishments in the catering trade in

Municipal area of Vienna are also covered by the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance and by

these – presumably – equally personal data of the complainant were collected

would.

The data processing can therefore not be based on Article 9 (2) (a) GDPR.

b) The existence of a legal obligation to collect or process data

customer data

i) The Respondent relies on the fact that permission is granted – which is not relevant here alone

of Article 6(1)(c) GDPR and argues that, pursuant to Section 5(3) EpiG in conjunction with Section 1(2)(e) of the

Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance on the processing and storage of the data of the

Complainant legally obliged for 4 weeks.

The complainant denied the existence of a legal obligation and argued that

from § 5 para. 3 EpiG and the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance only the obligation of

Respondent to provide information to the district administrative authority can be deduced,

but not for the collection of customer data.

ii) The processing of special categories of personal data on the basis of a statutory

Obligation is - as far as relevant for the present case - according to Art. 9 Para. 2 lit.

then permissible if the processing is for reasons of public interest in the area of

public health, such as protection against serious transboundary

Health hazards, based on Union law or the law of a Member State, the

appropriate and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of those affected

It should therefore be noted that the (mandatory) processing of personal data for the purpose

of contact tracing is covered by the GDPR, provided a sufficiently precise and

However, it is questionable whether § 5 para. 3 EpiG in conjunction with the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance as

Legal basis within the meaning of Article 9 (2) (i) GDPR can be used.

The Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance issued on the basis of Section 5 (3) EpiG specifies this

Obligation and stipulates in § 1 that to prevent the spread of COVID-19 [...] for the

In the event of a suspected case of COVID-19 from the following authorities

Information to be provided upon request of the district administrative authority".

The standard text of § 1 Z 1 and Z 2 of the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance contains an enumeration

of the bodies obliged to provide information and thus specifies who among “all persons who belong to the

surveys could make a contribution" is to be understood within the meaning of Section 5 (3) EpiG. Likewise, in § 1

Z 1 and Z 2 of the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance the mandatory content of such information

determined. Accordingly, gastronomy establishments are in the event of the occurrence of a

suspected case of COVID-19 at the request of the district administrative authorities, information

about the first name, surname, telephone number, e-mail address and telephone number of their customers

to grant customers.

According to the established case law of the Administrative Court, the interpretation of laws is the interpretation of the word

in conjunction with grammatical and systematic interpretation

and extreme reluctance to use so-called

"corrective

methods of interpretation”.

(cf. VwGH 3.10.2018, Ro 2018/12/0014; 22.3.2019,

Ra 2018/04/0089).

According to the wording of the legal provisions in question (§ 5 Para. 3 EpiG in conjunction with § 1 Z 2

lit. e Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance) is an obligation to process personal data

However, this does not include data from customers who visit the premises of a catering establishment

intended. The provisions obviously standardize an obligation to provide information

to the district administration authority and these provisions also determine what content

(Data) has to contain such information, but according to the unambiguous and clear wording therein

no obligation to collect and process this data.

Also from the wording of § 2 of the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance, according to which data iSd § 1 of

in § 1 leg. cit. mentioned bodies may be processed and stored is not a legal one

obligation to process, but merely to derive a legal ability. It is not

to assume that the legislator subconsciously speaks of may, but is of it

to assume that if he had wanted to standardize a legal obligation, he would

expressly made clear.

Against such an interpretation, however, could be objected that it holders of

gastronomy establishments would be practically impossible without prior data collection

to comply with the obligation to provide information stipulated in the regulation and a violation of § 5 EpiG

§ 40 lit. a EpiG establishes an administrative offense punishable by up to 1,450 euros

punish is.

However, there can be no legal obligation to perform the factually impossible,

which is why the obligation to provide information can only relate to data that the owner of a

Business premises of the gastronomy are available without any special investigative effort.

It is therefore evident that there is a legal obligation to process the data

of the complainant - as submitted by the respondent - by no means clearly from the

Wording of Section 5 (3) EpiG in conjunction with the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance. Nor can it

the obligation to provide information to the district administrative authority without further ado

a legal obligation of the Respondent to collect and process certain

personal data will be closed. The obligation to provide information can be

The wording of the legal provisions apply only to personal data provided to the holder

are known to a catering establishment.

iii) For this reason alone, an appeal by the Respondent to one of her legal claims fails

imposed obligation to process personal data of the complainant.

iv) But even in the event that Section 5 (3) EpiG in conjunction with the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance

derive an obligation to process personal data within the meaning of Article 9 (2) (i) GDPR

wanted, data processing could not be based on:

c) Requirements for legal bases

i) According to the settled case law of the ECJ, regulations that are part of the rights under Art. 7

(Respect for private and family life) or Art. 8 (Protection of personal data) EU-GRC

intervene, provide for clear and precise rules on the scope and application of this measure

and establish minimum requirements so that the individuals whose personal data are affected

have sufficient guarantees that effectively protect their data from misuse

as well as against any unauthorized access to this data and any unauthorized use,

enable. The need for such guarantees is all the more significant when the personal

Data are processed automatically and there is a significant risk of unauthorized access

consists of them (cf. ECJ of October 6, 2015, C-362-14, para. 91 with further references).

These guarantees are all the more important when data is processed automatically and when

it is sensitive data (cf. ECJ of October 6, 2020, related cases C-511/18, C-512/18 and

C-520/18, margin no. 132).

For those to be processed on the basis of Section 5 (3) EpiG in conjunction with the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance

Data is - as explained in more detail above - health data according to Art. 4 Z 15 DSGVO.

Also the consistent jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court on the quality of an overriding norm in

Within the meaning of Section 1 (2) DSG, it can be inferred that this must meet certain requirements (cf.

more recently the findings of December 11, 2019, G 72/2019 and others, and of December 12, 2019,

G 164/2019 and others).

However, the data protection authority expressly makes it clear that it is neither their task - nor of it

their competence is not covered - to finally determine whether the subject of the proceedings

Provisions are contrary to § 1 Para. 2 DSG or Art. 8 EU-GRC.

However, the data protection authority is obliged to comply with national regulations that are in a

manifest contradiction with Union law, should be left unapplied in the event of a conflict.

The principle of the primacy of Union law over national law applies

(Application priority). This is of particular importance where directly applicable

Union law - such as the GDPR - meets conflicting national law. the

Precedence of application means that in the event of a conflict, the rule of the (directly applicable)

Union law, not that of Austrian law (cf. VfSlg. 15.448/1999,

19.661/2012 with reference; Mayer/Kucsko-Stadlmayer/Stöger, Federal Constitutional Law11 [2015] Rz 246/9).

This principle must be observed by all Austrian authorities, they have national law

should therefore not be applied in such cases. On the rank of Austrian law comes

It does not matter, Union law also takes precedence over national constitutional law in the event of a conflict (cf. VfSlg.

15.427/1999; 17.347/2003; Mayer/Kucsko-Stadlmayer/Stöger, Federal Constitutional Law11

[2015]

Margin no. 246/9).

The scope of an intervention must be clear from the text of the standard itself. But if to

Determination of meaning Subtle knowledge of data protection law, qualified legal qualifications and

Experience and almost archival diligence - above all through intensive study of legal materials

and other aids - is necessary (cf. mutatis mutandis VfSlg. 12.420/1990), cannot be said

be that the effects of legally stipulated data processing are simple

to understand.

However, the (simple) traceability is in turn a prerequisite for those affected to understand the scope

to become aware of an interference and to be able to claim their rights. This will already

set out in Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR (principle of lawfulness, processing in good faith

faith, transparency).

According to the case law of the ECJ, it is not sufficient if data processing is based on one of the

Art. 6 GDPR - or as here: Art. 9 Para. 2 - conclusively mentioned legality

can be supported; there must also be all the principles governing the processing of personal data

Data according to Art. 5 DSGVO are complied with (cf. the legal situation according to Directive 95/46/EC das

Judgment of December 11, 2019, C-708/18, margin no. 36).

ii) Applied to the present case, this means the following:

The standard in Section 5 (3) EpiG in conjunction with Section 1 (2) (e) of the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance

Data processing for owners of catering establishments contains - as can be seen from the above

statements results in - neither clear nor precise rules for the scope and application of these

Measure. In particular, for those affected, the circumstances when there is an intervention in the in § 1

DSG or Art. 8 EU-GRC constitutionally or primary law guarantees the right to data protection

and whether this data must be disclosed (see the explanations above),

not clearly evident.

In the light of the case law of the ECJ, which – especially when it comes to sensitive processing

Data goes - to regulations that fall into the rights under Art. 7 (respect for private and family life)

or Art. 8 (Protection of personal data) EU-GRC, clear and precise requirements

standardized for the scope and application of this measure, the provisions of § 5

Para. 3 EpiG in conjunction with the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance due to the primacy of Union law

subject to remain unapplied, leaving an obligation to process

personal data cannot be based on it.

The complaint therefore proves to be justified from this point of view as well.

d) Violation of the principle of "good faith"

i) However, the complaint also proves to be justified based on the following considerations:

The Respondent submits that the Complainant provided his data voluntarily

placed. As can be seen in the statements in their privacy policy, they link the survey

of their customers' data, however, with access to their business premises or states that

a customer who refuses to provide their data will be denied access

can. In addition, in its data protection declaration, it refers to the legal basis for the

Processing based on Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR in conjunction with Section 1 (2) (e) of the Vienna Contact Tracing Ordinance.

ii) As already stated, it is not sufficient that data processing is based on a permit

can be supported, but must also comply with all principles of Art. 5 GDPR

respectively. According to Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. a DSGVO data must be in good faith in a for the

Data subjects are processed in a comprehensible manner.

As a result, the practice of the complainant turns out to be based on a

– insufficient – legal obligation to invoke the processing, the collection however

at the same time dependent on the voluntary information provided by your customers as misleading. Then

in this way, the impression is given to the person concerned that they are in control of the processing

to be able to exercise.

In this respect, the Respondent has violated the principle of Art. 5 (1) lit

Faith") violated and thereby the Complainant in his right to secrecy

§ 1 DSG violated

(cf. above; notification DSB of October 31, 2018,

GZ: DSB-D123.076/0003-DSB/2018).

4. Result

The complaint therefore proves to the extent that a violation in the right to secrecy is alleged

because the Respondent's first and last name as well as the telephone number of the complainant

determined without a legal basis as justified, which is why the decision had to be taken in accordance with the verdict.

 

Regarding point 2:

Insofar as the complaint is against the processing of data other than that specified in the information

of the complainant, it turns out to be unfounded in the absence of actual processing.

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.
