According to Art. 57 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR, each supervisory authority in its sovereign territory must

deal with complaints from a data subject.

In accordance with Section 24 (1) DSG, every data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with the

Data Protection Authority when it considers that the processing is relevant to you

the data protection authority in good time.

4. In the matter:

Regarding point 1:

Art. 15 GDPR reads:

If this is the case, she has a right to information about this personal data and

to make the information available in a commonly used electronic format, provided that
she says nothing else.

(4) The right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph 1b shall not affect the rights and freedoms

Article 4 Z 2 GDPR reads:

"Processing" means any operation carried out with or without the aid of automated procedures
or any such series of operations involving personal data such as that
Collecting, capturing, organizing, arranging, storing, adapting or
Modification, reading, querying, use, disclosure by
transmission, distribution or any other form of provision, comparison or
linking, restriction, deletion or destruction;

§ 14 para. 4 DSG 2000 read:

"Log and documentation data may not be used for purposes associated with
their purpose of investigation - that is to check the admissibility of the use of the
logged or documented database - are incompatible. is incompatible

Reason than that of checking their access authorization, unless it is the
Use for the purpose of preventing or prosecuting a crime under Section 278a
StGB (criminal organization) or a crime punishable by imprisonment whose
exceeds a maximum of five years.”

In a letter dated November 26, the complainant requested information as to who

September 2015 to date (November 26, 2017) has accessed their data.

Art. 15 GDPR does not provide for any special form for the request for information.

In this case, the complainant requested information in writing by e-mail and

Response can also be sent via e-mail if requested.

For the assessment of whether there is a request for information under data protection law, this is

To examine desire for its content, whereby that standard is to be applied, which also applies to

Unilateral declarations of intent under private law apply (wording and understanding of the declaration

from an objective point of view; , as they the recipient according to their wording and business purpose

could understand when viewed objectively´, OGH EvBl 1974/185 [termination]; cf

the decision of the Federal Administrative Court of April 17, 2015, GZ W214 2010977-1).

In her request for information pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR, the complainant is entitled to

e-mail dated November 26, 2017 unmistakably stated that

they only ask for information made by other employees of the respondent

access to their health data (medical history).

For the requested information on internal access:

According to the decision of the Federal Administrative Court on GZ W214 2117640-1 of July 11th

2017 on the question of whether log data is to be disclosed under Section 14 DSG 2000

Queries from employees of the person responsible, which are within the original

Responsibilities move, not the obligation to provide information, as long as they do not transmit

represent.

This case law can be transferred to the new legal situation.

According to Art. 15 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR, recipients are to whom data is disclosed

have been to provide information.

According to Art. 4 Z 9 GDPR, "recipient" is a natural or legal person, authority,

institution or other body to which personal data is disclosed,

regardless of whether it is a third party or not.

Art. 4 Z 10 GDPR defines "third party" as a natural or legal person, authority,

Institution or other body, other than the data subject, the person responsible, the

processors and the persons who are under the direct responsibility of the

Controller or the processor are authorized to process the personal data

to process.

As the Respondent himself admitted in the proceedings regarding GZ DSB-D122.831,

the mentioned accesses were inadmissible because there was no legal justification for it.

However, it is clear that these accesses were made by a "third party", because the

Inquiring person "was not authorized to process the personal data."

According to the case law of the Federal Administrative Court cited above,

procedural access is therefore subject to the obligation to provide information under Art. 15 GDPR.

Regarding point 2:

The performance mandate is based on Article 58 (2) (c) GDPR in conjunction with Article 24 (5) DSG, whereby

in § 24 para. 5 leg. cit. standardized restriction to those responsible for the private

Area not applied due to the direct precedence of Union law

has to stay.

To the extent that the complainant accused the respondent of abuse of official authority

accuses, the data protection authority is also responsible for decisions in judicial criminal matters

little as responsible for labor and social court disputes.
