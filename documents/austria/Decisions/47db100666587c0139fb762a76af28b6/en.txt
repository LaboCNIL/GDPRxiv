datenschutz@n***.at) not valid.

In a letter dated August 6, 2018, the Respondent granted the

complainant in writing information and sent a copy of this information to the

Data Protection Authority.

In his statement of August 13, 2018, the complainant stated that he

did not accept the complainant's information because it was not within a

month from the submission of his request for information and is therefore not within the deadline.

In addition, the data protection authority has nothing against the incorrect e-mail address

violated his right to information by submitting his request for information

of June 1, 2018 only answered on August 6, 2018 and be the complainant

C. Findings of Facts

On June 1, 2018, the complainant submitted a written request for information to the

provides.

The Respondent also offers a contact option on its website at

https://www.n***.at/datenschutzerklaerung (retrieved on 08/20/2018) the e-mail address

***-datenschutzbeauftragter@n***.at.

It could not be determined that the e-mail address on the website of the

Respondent at one point was ***-datenschutz@n***.at.

The respondent replied to the complainant's request for information

not within the allotted period of one month, which is why the complainant

on July 27, 2018, a complaint about a violation of the right to information at the

data protection authority raised.

In a letter dated August 6, 2018, the Respondent granted the

Complainant in writing information and submitted a copy of this information on

your data protection officer, H*** & O*** Rechtsanwälte KG, to the

Data Protection Authority.

Evidence assessment: The statements made are based on what is undisputed in this respect

submissions of the parties. The determinations regarding the e-mail address are based on

the accessed website of the Respondent on August 20, 2018.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. To exceed the one-month period:

Art. 12 para. 3 GDPR reads including the title (emphasis added by the

Data Protection Authority):

Article 12

Transparent information, communication and modalities for the exercise of

rights of

affected person

(1) [...] (2)

(3) The person responsible shall provide the data subject with information on the request

Person within one month of receipt of the request for an extension of time,
along with the reasons for the delay. The data subject submits the request
electronically, it is to be informed electronically if possible, provided that it
states nothing else.

§ 24 para. 6 DSG reads including the title (emphasis added by the

Data Protection Authority):

(6) A respondent may, until the conclusion of the proceedings before the

The Austrian legislator has the responsible person in § 24 Abs. 6 DSG

Possibility created, alleged violations of rights in Art. 12 Para. 3

GDPR beyond, specifically until the end of the

Complaints procedure before the data protection authority, to be eliminated afterwards.

By the Respondent informing the Complainant of its request for information

August 6, 2018 and thus his request for information of June 1, 2018

corresponded, she made use of the legal provision of § 24 Para. 6 DSG

and the alleged infringement was subsequently eliminated.

The complainant's argument that the period of one month is not

was complied with is therefore basically correct, but leads through the used

Possibility of subsequent elimination according to § 24 paragraph 6 DSG.

2. To assert the request for information by email:

Art. 12 para. 2 GDPR reads including the title (emphasis added by the

Data Protection Authority):

Article 12

Transparent information, communication and modalities for the exercise of

rights of

affected person

(1)  […]

(2) The controller makes it easier for the data subject to exercise their rights
in accordance with Articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to in Article 11, paragraph 2, the

In what specific form the responsible persons concerned exercise their

Rights allowed, therefore by email, web form or otherwise, is by law

not provided for as long as the exercise of these rights is not made more difficult.

By having a web form for the Respondent on its website

Provides requests for information in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR, it offers data subjects

Persons a suitable opportunity to exercise their rights to information within the meaning of

Art. 12 para. 2 GDPR.

There is also an additional contact option on the Respondent's website

visible via email. Even if that email address hasn't been in the past

should have worked, the complainant could still exercise his right to

Claim information using the web form mentioned and otherwise existed for him

also the possibility to send his request for information by post to the respondent

address, which is why there is no violation of Art. 12 Para. 2 DSGVO.

3. Conclusions:

From the point of view of the data protection authority, the result is not a justified complaint

of the complainant for information in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR and was the complaint

therefore, for the reasons discussed above, according to Section 24 (5) DSG

to reject.

If the complainant submits that the respondent has a copy of the

information to your data protection officer and the data protection authority,

although the information was not explicitly intended for third parties, it should be noted that

The subject of this procedure is the non-disclosure of information in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR
