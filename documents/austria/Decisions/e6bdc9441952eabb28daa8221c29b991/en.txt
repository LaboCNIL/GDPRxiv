relevant information transmitted. In any case, the accused would have nothing left to do

procedures can contribute. From a legal point of view, this view cannot and is not to be followed

counter the following:

 

3.

First of all, it should be noted that the accused, based on the findings in

the case in question and based on the findings in the respective complaints proceedings

undoubtedly as the operator and thus responsible within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 7 DSGVO for the

processing

the

and

is. The role as operator of the Whatsapp group and its purpose (immediate and

efficient communication between the accused's employees and for transmission

of service instructions, changes in daily working hours and shifts) are

not disputed by the accused in the present case. The accused even admits this



Role and its purpose in its justification of August 3rd, 2020 (see page 2, point I. third

dash). Subject of the respective complaint procedures at the data protection authority

was the question of whether the accused violated the persons concerned in their right to secrecy according to § 1

DSG violated by providing health data and other data in this Whatsapp group

disclosed to other employees. The accused was thus in her capacity as

responsible for data protection within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 7 DSGVO and thus as

Respondent involved in the respective complaint proceedings according to § 24 para. 2 no. 2 DSG.

 

4.

As the person responsible, the accused is - on request - pursuant to Art. 31 GDPR

obliged to cooperate with a supervisory authority in the performance of their duties.

The data protection authority is the supervisory authority within the meaning of Article 51 GDPR (see also Article 18

Paragraph 1 DSG). The tasks of a supervisory authority are defined in Art. 57 GDPR. To

Art. 57 (1) lit. f GDPR, each supervisory authority in its respective sovereign territory must

with complaints from a data subject or complaints from a body or organization

or an association pursuant to Art. 80 GDPR, the object of the complaint in

reasonable extent investigate and the complainant

within one

inform you within a reasonable period of time about the progress and the result of the investigation,

especially when further investigation or coordination with another

supervisory authority is required. There is an obligation to treat incoming complaints

within the scope of Article 57 (1) (f) GDPR. The supervisory authority must make such a complaint

with all due care (see the judgment of the ECJ of July 16, 2020,

C-311/18, margin no. 109). The powers of a supervisory authority are regulated in Article 58 GDPR.

According to Article 58 (1) (a) GDPR, a supervisory authority has the power to

the processor and, where applicable, the representative of the controller or the

To instruct the processor to provide all information necessary for the fulfillment

of their duties are required. From this provision

is already one

Obligation to cooperate of the norm addressees can be derived (cf. Bogendorfer

in knyrim,

DatKomm Art 31 DSGVO margin no. 4). According to § 22 Para. 1 DSG, the data protection authority from

must take the necessary investigative measures according to § 39 AVG ex officio. Of the

Principle of substantive truth states that the real facts of the authority

must investigate ex officio and not to the submissions of the parties in one

adversarial procedure.

 

5.

It can thus be stated as an interim result that the

Requests for statements to the accused in the respective complaint procedures



in any case by the powers in Union law and the requirements of national law

are covered and that the proper investigation of the subject matter of the complaint is a - im

AVG will investigate the relevant facts ex officio and is a party to the proceedings

also obliged to participate in the determination of the relevant facts (cf

the decision of the Administrative Court of May 27, 2019, Ra 2019/14/0153). For this reason alone

comes to the objection of the accused that they were not obliged to comment

to submit, no authorization to.

 

6.

But even if one wanted to assume that no obligation to cooperate in a

adversarial proceedings and any omission at the expense of not

involved party, the objection of the accused has no justification:

 

7.

The norm addressees of Art. 31 GDPR have namely at the request of the supervisory authority

to work with her. You therefore do not have to act on your own initiative, unless the

GDPR specifically provides for this in a provision (e.g. in Art. 33 and 36 GDPR). the

Complaint procedures were sufficiently defined in terms of content and the accused could

Hear allegations and give her the opportunity to present her own point of view. That

The outcome of adversarial proceedings depends by its very nature on whether

the explanations of the parties to the proceedings are justified or not, because ultimately it is only

there can be a winning party. The statements of the accused in the course of the

Hearing of August 3rd, 2020 and the written justifications of August 3rd, 2020 and

September 10th, 2020 it can be seen that the accused clearly understood the object and purpose of the

was able to understand requests for comment. However, she felt that her

Opinion is no longer required, since the data protection authority all relevant

information. For this reason, no statement - despite the urge - was submitted. the

Requests for comments are therefore in any case to be regarded as proper "requests from a

supervisory authority”.

 

9.

As a result, it can therefore be stated that already based on the wording of

 

Art. 31 GDPR the accused the objective factual side of the administrative offense of Art. 83

Para. 4 lit. a GDPR by being responsible for the multiple

did not respond to requests for comment in the respective complaints procedures and

has thereby failed to fulfill its obligation to cooperate with the data protection authority.

The obligation to cooperate can also be derived from the fact that a supervisory authority is not

can be assumed from the outset to make senseless inquiries that have no connection

stand with their enforcement activities.

 

10. The allegation of the accused that she therefore did not submit any more statements,

since she could not have contributed anything more to the procedure, since the data protection authority anyway

already had all the relevant information, the following must also be countered:

 

11. The accused contradicts her own argument with this assertion, since she

one of the three complaint procedures (to GZ: D124.289) - albeit clearly after the

given deadline, but before the decision is issued - two statements in a row

submitted on November 20, 2019 and November 22, 2019. In the course of these statements, the

Accused, as established in the facts, further factual elements in connection

with the disclosure of the notification of incapacity to work within the Whatsapp group and

put forward some arguments with regard to the legal assessment of the facts (e.g.

the lack of passive legitimacy). From this alone it follows that the data protection authority does not

has received all relevant information submitted by the complainants. the

Although comments were clearly delayed, no decision had been received by then

enacted, which is why the statements of the accused

anyway

in the

Investigative proceedings were taken up and subsequently also addressed in the decision.

The statements of the accused have thus to determine the authoritative

facts contributed. Thus, the view of the accused cannot be followed at all

that she was no longer able to contribute to the proceedings (cf. again that already

cited decision of the Administrative Court of May 27, 2019).

 

12. On the illegal and culpable behavior of the management and attribution of the

behavior to the legal person

In the course of her written justification dated September 10, 2020, the accused raised

the fault of the managing director B *** summarized, that in any case no

fault on the part of the managing director. Should the data protection authority nevertheless

assume fault, there is only fault of a "minor degree". The only

Misconduct that the manager could be accused of is the fact that he

has failed to find out about the further course of the procedure with the data protection authority

to inform. This is due to the suspect's residence in xxx, Spain.

From a legal point of view, this view of the accused cannot be followed and is explained below

 

explained in more detail:

 

13. According to § 30 paragraph 2 DSG, legal persons can be prosecuted for violations of the provisions of the

GDPR and § 1 or Article 2 1st main part of the DSG be held responsible if

Lack of supervision or control by a person named in Section 30 (1) DSG

commission of these violations by a person working for the legal entity.

The decisive question here is whether an effective internal control system is in place at the

accused was implemented, here in particular for the day-to-day operations in

to monitor Austria from Spain.

 

14

As part of the legal assessment of whether

in the present case an effective one

control system was set up, are the following considerations from the judicature of the VwGH

in any case, to take into account:

 

15. An effective control system requires that possible violations are systematically monitored

is investigated, these violations are documented and addressed accordingly

Consequences (e.g. to improve instructions or training,

possibly also lead to disciplinary measures), so in the end with good reason

it can be expected that compliance with regulations is guaranteed (cf. VwGH

07.03.2016, Ra 2016/02/0030, mwH).

 

16. In demonstrating an effective control system, it is necessary to do so, among other things

to show which measures in detail the immediate superior within the framework of the

control system was obliged to enforce that everyone in this

Employees involved in the control system actually comply with the relevant regulations

to ensure overall, i.e. in particular to enforce or ensure that the

orders (instructions) issued by the respective higher level to comply with the

Regulations as well as the relevant training courses also to the respective subordinate, i.e. last

reach the lowest hierarchical level and are actually followed there (cf. from

settled case law

such as Administrative Court

June 9, 2017, Ra 2017/02/0068;

7.3.2016,

Ra 2016/03/0030).

 

17

In the context of the implementation of the existing for employees

Control duties must not be disregarded that straight

cannot be fully relied on, that instructed, ongoing

the explanations of the party concerned a control system in the sense mentioned

is in place or whether the control system shown has been adequately observed in order to

to make a lack of fault credible (cf. VwGH 12.2.2020, Ra 2020/02/0005;

March 7th, 2016, Ra 2016/02/0030, with further references).

 

18. Transferred to the facts in question can therefore, taking into account the

consistent case law of the VwGH on the effective control system in connection with

the fault of the responsible person, the following is recorded:

As a result, it can therefore be summarized that the managing director of

Within the scope of his function - acted objectively carelessly and there is fault in form

of negligence. The unlawful and culpable behavior of the managing director

attributed to the accused as a legal entity in accordance with § 30 para. and 2 DSG.

 

24. To exclude the criminal liability of the accused's management

According to § 30 paragraph 3 DSG, the data protection authority has the right to punish a person responsible

according to § 9 of the Administrative Penal Act 1991 - VStG, Federal Law Gazette No. 52/1991, if for

an administrative fine has already been imposed on the legal entity for the same violation.

The personal administrative criminal prosecution and punishment of the managing director of

Accused was due to the exclusion standard of § 30 para. 3 DSG thus - from legal

reasons - not allowed.

 

IV. The following must be noted for sentencing:

 

1. Pursuant to Art. 83 Para. 1 GDPR, the data protection authority must ensure that the

the imposition of fines for violations pursuant to paragraphs 5 and 6 is effective in each individual case,

is proportionate and dissuasive. In more detail, paragraph 2 leg. cit

Decision on the imposition of a fine and its amount in each individual case

The following should be given due consideration:

a)

Nature, severity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, extent or

the purpose of the processing in question and the number of data processed

affected persons and the extent of the damage suffered by them;

b)

intentional or negligent breach;

c)

any measures taken by the controller or processor

to mitigate the damage caused to the data subjects;

d)

f)

Extent of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and

mitigate its potential adverse effects;

and, if applicable, to what extent the controller or the processor

 

notified the breach;

i)

j)

k)

Losses.

 

2. According to Section 19 (1) of the VStG, the basis for assessing the penalty is the importance of the

legal interest protected by criminal law and the intensity of its impairment by the act.

Moreover, according to the purpose of the threat of punishment, the aggravating and

Mitigation grounds, insofar as they do not already determine the threat of punishment, against each other

to weigh. Particular attention should be paid to the degree of culpability. Under

Sections 32 to 35 of the

apply the Criminal Code mutatis mutandis. Income and assets and

any duties of care on the part of the accused are included in the assessment of fines

take into account (this naturally only applies to natural persons, but is analogous to

to transfer legal persons); this, however, only to the extent that the directly

applicable provisions of the GDPR are the provisions of the VStG

supersede and to the extent permitted by Art. 83 (8) GDPR and recital 148

is ordered with regard to the procedural guarantees to be guaranteed.

 

3. With Art. 83 Para. 3 GDPR, in deviation from the standard with § 22 Para. 2 VStG

Accumulation principle arranged that

in cases of the same or related ones

Processing operations that intentionally or negligently violate several provisions of the

GDPR is violated, the total amount of the fine does not include the amount for the

exceeds the most serious violation. Thus, within the scope of the GDPR - as in

applied in the present case – the absorption principle of Art. 83 (3) GDPR.

 

4. Pursuant to Article 83, paragraph 4, in the event of violations referred to therein, in accordance with paragraph 2,

Fines of up to EUR 10 000 000 or in the case of a company up to 2% of its

total worldwide annual sales of the previous financial year imposed, depending

depending on which of the amounts is higher. The term turnover within the meaning of Art. 83 para. 4 and 5

GDPR is to be understood in the sense of the net sales of Directive 2013/34/EU. Thereafter

net sales are the amounts resulting from the sale of products and the provision of services

of services after deduction of sales deductions and value added tax as well as

other taxes directly related to the turnover (Art. 2 Z 5 RL 2013/34/EU).

7.

Based on the facts at hand, the following was mitigating in the sentencing

taken into account:

 

a.

Since the data protection authority in relation to the violations of the

Obligation to cooperate with supervisory authorities not from intentional, but from

negligent inspection, this was in relation to the possible maximum penalty

significantly mitigating the penalty;

b. The data protection authority has no previous relevant records against the accused

c.

The concrete penalty imposed in the amount of EUR 3,000.00 therefore appears with regard to the
