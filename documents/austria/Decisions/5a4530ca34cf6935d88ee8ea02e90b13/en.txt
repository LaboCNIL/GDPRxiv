D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. General

The legal situation at the time of the decision of the data protection authority is decisive,

unless it is a matter of judging a behavior towards a particular

Time. However, the object of the complaint does not become a specific date

or period turned off.

According to the legal situation applicable from May 25, 2018, this was the case until now

the DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 in the version of Federal Law Gazette I No. 83/2013, as

Complaints procedure according to § 24 DSG, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended (cf

Section 69 (4) DSG).

2. On the right to correction and completion in accordance with Article 16 GDPR

Art. 16 GDPR reads including the title (emphasis added by the data protection authority):

Article 16

Right to Rectification

The data subject has the right to have the person responsible immediately
to request the correction of incorrect personal data concerning you. Under
Considering the purposes of the processing, the data subject has the right
Completion of incomplete personal data - also by means of a
supplementary declaration - to demand.

a) Art. 16 GDPR pursues the objective protection goal, the factual correctness of

(re)establish processed personal data. prerequisite for that

The right to rectification is the objective inaccuracy of this personal data.

The concept of incorrectness is a concept that is to be interpreted autonomously under Union law

not defined by the GDPR. The central standard of incorrectness is the objective one

Meaningfulness of the data, regardless of what they are according to the subjective opinion of the

testify to those responsible or those affected.

According to common parlance, incorrect stands for wrong, untrue, inapplicable or

adulterating.

Data (such as the content of a saved text document) contained within the boundaries

of the prohibition of excess (cf. the established case law of

Data Protection Commission, such as the decision of November 29, 2005, GZ

K121.046/0016-DSK/2005) for the purposes of an official procedure,

are considered correct from a data protection point of view if they do the corresponding

Proceedings result (e.g. a file from another authority, a report from a

official body, an expert opinion or the statement of an evidence person)

formally correct. The truth of the content of the information (e.g. in the case of a

testimony), the value of evidence or its admissibility in proceedings

before the authority acting as responsible, it comes, subject to express

other legal regulations, in this context, however, not.

(cf. the decision of the Data Protection Commission of June 14, 2013, GZ DSB-

K121.939/0010-DSK/2013)

Is the purpose of the data application solely in the documentation of opinions or

assessment, the data are correct from a data protection point of view if they

Correctly express an opinion or judgement. (cf. the decision of

Data Protection Commission of March 21, 2007, GZ K121.246/0008-DSK/2007)

b) According to Art. 16 sentence 2 GDPR, the data subject has, taking into account the

Purposes of processing the right to complete incomplete

to request personal data.

The prerequisite for this is incompleteness: such are incomplete

personal information, while accurate on its own, taken as a whole

but make an objectively wrong statement or incomplete and therefore objective

are misleading.

The overall context must be taken into account, taking all circumstances into account.

The specific processing purpose must be taken into account. The legal duty

the person responsible for completion exists only in those cases in which the

added information is actually relevant for the processing in order to

to ensure the objective accuracy of the data.

3. On the electronic personnel file that is the subject of the proceedings

a) According to Art. 2 Para. 1 GDPR, the material scope of application extends

DSGVO on the automated processing of personal data and on the

non-automated processing of personal data stored in a file system

are stored or are to be stored. The electronic personnel file, the one

digital collection of data held by the employer about the employee

in any case under the scope of the GDPR.

The complainant's request was based on the information in the personnel file

to correct that the complainant

not guilty of breach of duty. Information about the

Complainant, as in the given case in the personal file of the Respondent

are contained are personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 1 DSGVO and therefore

in principle accessible to a correction according to Art. 16 DSGVO.

The Respondent has the relevant documents in her personnel file

documented and thus formally correctly reproduced. There is no data in the personnel file

contain that can be qualified as false, untrue, inaccurate or falsifying.

The complainant has no right to rectification to the effect that information that

are subjectively important to them, are included in the documentation, or

certain formulations are specified by it (cf. the decision of the

Data Protection Commission of September 24, 2010, GZ K121.608/00014-DSK/2010).

It cannot be deduced from the documented parts of the file that the allegation

a breach of duty or other behavior contrary to duty. It

was only the exact process - from suspicion to the appropriate

Statements according to which the suspicion has not been substantiated - documented, among other things

also that the enveloped notification of incapacity for work was found later and

that the intended termination was then refrained from.

In the present case, therefore, the prerequisite for incorrectness was already lacking

of personal data in the personnel file.

b) Regarding the right to completion: The question of (in)completeness is up

to determine the basis of the specific processing purpose. The added ones

Information must therefore actually be relevant to the processing process in order to

to ensure objective accuracy.

Adding the information that the complainant was not in breach of duty

behaved is, with regard to the processing purpose (documentation,

Personnel administration) not relevant, because this information is already from a

Summary of all relevant documents. The information in the personnel file

are not incomplete or objectively misleading. It doesn't lie with that either

incomplete personal data in the personnel file.

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.
