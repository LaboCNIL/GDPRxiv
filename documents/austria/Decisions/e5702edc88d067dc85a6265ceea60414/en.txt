D. In legal terms it follows that:

D.1. General

The legal situation at the time of the decision of the data protection authority is decisive,

unless it is a matter of judging a behavior towards a particular

Time. However, the object of the complaint does not become a specific date

or period turned off. The alleged infringement (incomplete information)

still ongoing.

According to the legal situation applicable from May 25, 2018, this was the case until now

the DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 in the version of Federal Law Gazette I No. 83/2013, as

Complaints procedure according to § 24 DSG, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended, to continue and after

to decide on the new legal situation (cf. Section 69 (4) DSG).

D.2. Applicable legislation:

Art. 15 para. 1 and para. 4 GDPR read together with the title (emphasis added by the

Data Protection Authority):

Article 15

Right of access of the data subject

(1) The data subject has the right to receive confirmation from the person responsible
to request whether you are processing personal data relating to you
will; if this is the case, she has a right to information about this

in particular for recipients in third countries or international organizations;

in these cases  -
meaningful information about the logic involved as well as the scope and the
intended effects of such processing for the data subject.

(2) [...] (3)

  

(4) The right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph 1b shall not affect the rights and freedoms
not affect other people.

 

  

§ 17 AVG reads including the heading (emphasis added by the data protection authority):

insight into files

Section 17. (1) Unless otherwise specified in the administrative regulations, the
Parties can inspect the files relating to their case at the authority and

inspection damage to the legitimate interests of a party or third parties
or jeopardize the tasks of the authority or the purpose of the
would affect the procedure.
(4) Denying access to the file to the party of a pending
Proceedings are carried out by procedural order.

 

D.3. In the matter itself:

1. The complainant filed a June 2, 2018 improvement

incomplete provision of information applies. A non-disclosure of the information was therefore

not subject of the proceedings.

The complainant believes, in summary, a concrete, substantive

Part of the file - namely a copy of the e-mail advertisement from the advertiser (including

Photos) – which he, as a party to, the proceedings Zl. MA 36-*4*2*7-2016 within the framework of

Assertion of the right to inspect the files had not received about the

to be able to assert the right to information.

2. First of all, it should be noted that the previous case law on the right to information according to § 26

DSG 2000 of information in the sense of a copy of specific file components

rejected (cf. decision of the Data Protection Commission of June 4, 2001

to GZ K120.810/005-DSK/2001, notices of June 27, 2012, GZ K121.803/0008-

DSK/2012, as well as of April 25, 2008, GZ K121.340/0006-DSK/2008, notices of

March 9th, 2015, GZ DSB-D122.299/0003-DSB/2015, and from October 27th, 2014, GZ DSB-

D122.215/0004-DSB/2014). On the one hand, this was justified by the fact that § 26 para. 1

DSG 2000 and the constitutional provision of § 1 Para. 3 Z 1 DSG 2000

personal data of a data subject are limited, which

automated processing or for processing in manual files (e.g

index systems) are determined. On the other hand - based on the quoted

Constitutional provision and § 26 paragraph 1 DSG 2000 - neither a right to information about

Third Party Data, nor an enforceable right to obtain copies of deeds. and

Ultimately, § 26 Para. 8 DSG 2000 stipulated that to the extent that a

Data application regarding the processed data by law for the

data subjects can be viewed (i.e. if material legal provisions are available to data subjects

rights of inspection granted), the data protection right to information in accordance with the provisions

the material provisions providing for the right of inspection are to be granted, and

instead, the statutory provisions governing the inspection procedure

are relevant.

3. The now applicable DSG also sees in § 4 para. 5 and para. 6 DSG

Exceptions to the right to information according to Art. 15 GDPR - namely in sovereign

Area according to § 4 para. 5 DSG if the provision of information is the fulfillment

would jeopardize legally assigned tasks, in private or in the context of

Private sector administration in accordance with § 4 para. 6 DSG if the provision of information

jeopardizes a business or trade secret of the person responsible or a third party

would. However, both restrictions do not appear to apply in this case.

4. Therefore, only Art. 15 GDPR ("Right to information

of the data subject”). The GDPR itself mentions files and

File collections (still assuming that they are paper files) in

recital 15 last sentence, whereby these paper files are only not subject to the GDPR

should fall if the file system criterion is not met, thus an order

according to certain criteria (thus at least two criteria) does not exist.

E contrario it can be concluded that electronic files – such as these, among other things, too

the Respondent uses - at least the GDPR is applicable. recital 63

2nd sentence mentions that the content of files is fundamentally subject to the right to information

is subject (arg. "This includes the right of data subjects to information about their

their own health-related data, such as data in their medical records

Information such as diagnoses, examination results, findings of the

treating physicians and information on treatments or interventions").

Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR standardizes that the person responsible has a copy of the

provides personal data, whereby paragraph 4 stipulates restrictively,

that this does not affect the rights and freedoms of other people

may.

From all this it can be deduced that now by means of a request for information in principle

information about the content of documents and file components may also be requested

can.

5. However, according to Art. 15 DSGVO - as before - on your own

Limited to data, i.e. to data that, according to the wording of Art. 15 Para. 1 DSGVO,

"they [ie. the data subject] are personal data”. Hence

In principle, there is still no right to information about the

personal data of third parties, unless there are special reasons in the individual case

speak in favor of this (cf. e.g. the notification of June 6, 2018, GZ DSB-D122.829/0003-

DSB/2018).

In addition, Art. 15 Para. 4 GDPR standardizes the further restriction that the

Obtaining a copy of the personal data in any case the rights and freedoms

must not affect other people.

Therefore, if a document to be disclosed (a “copy”) contains data from third parties,

to carry out a weighing of interests and the data of third parties are only to be disclosed if

if the reasons for disclosure outweigh the reasons for secrecy.

6. In the present case, the express wish of the advertiser persisted

confidential treatment of his complaint. Predominant reasons for a disclosure

would give priority to secrecy were dated

Complainant not presented.

Consequently, Art. 15 Para. 4 GDPR requires a copy of the e-mail notification to be transmitted

opposite

7. The complaint was therefore to be dismissed as unfounded.
