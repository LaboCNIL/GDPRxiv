A. Submissions of the parties and course of the proceedings

1. With a procedural submission dated April 10, 2018, the complainant brought

that the Respondent operates in the area of in the joint ownership of several parties

standing handling and storage hall on GST **43/1 and on GST **51/2,

which is the sole property of the complainant, a video surveillance without

Approval and Consent. It will be with several video cameras

Entrance area to the "Chalet-Dependance" monitored. Since guests of the complainant

would arrive there by taxi and the like and the area not that

exclusive use of the Respondent is reserved, is the

Video surveillance not allowed. Whether a notification to the data processing register

had occurred was not known to the complainant.

2. With completion of April 13, 2018, GZ: DSB-D216.713/0001-DSB/2018, demanded the

data protection authority to comment on the allegations.

3. With a submission dated April 26, 2018, the Respondent commented and stated that

that the camera objects mentioned by the complainant are in an underground

tunnel system were installed. The Respondent disposes within this tunnel

about parking areas, while the complainant only has a right of access to her

have garage. It is correct that during the construction of the tunnel the

Video surveillance system had been installed - at that time with the consent of the

then owner Ms. Ulrike H***, who was the legal predecessor of the

complainant. The cameras have not been changed since then.

Camera 1 monitors the entrance to the garage, camera 2 the parking spaces

Respondent, camera 3 the emergency exit, camera 4 the entrance from the

Parking spaces for the Respondent's pension. So the cameras wouldn't

capture the complainant's garage and are with the consent of the former

owner attached. According to the legal situation at the time, there were no

Permissions were required and the Respondent relied on the

leave admissibility. In general, the real problem is that the

Appellant illegal taxi access contrary to the operating regulations of the tunnel

and also use the Respondent's parking spaces. This would

considerable disadvantages for the Respondent.

may that the owner of the video surveillance system at the time agreed

but last winter (2016/17) cameras 2 and 3 were renewed without

to involve the complainant. In any case, she is not a co-owner of the

physical video system. Also, based on the approval given at the time,

be concluded that the complainant now agrees and also not that

the monitoring is right. Also monitor the camera 3 the only

substantial access to the complainant's hotel premises.

due to the entry into force of § 24 DSG without a transitional period

be, may fix. At the same GZ, official determination of the

specification of a situation is requested. Also attached was the necessary

improvement of the defects to be remedied according to § 24. For this purpose it was stated

that the complainant's fundamental right to data protection was still violated

and the violation of rights would exist independently of storage. Next be them

Image material violated fundamental rights by the Respondent and her guests. It

would also result from the administrative penal proceedings of the BH Bludenz to BHBL-II-4***-

2013/0*67-*5 and a picture submitted there that the Respondent not only

their pitches, but rather the entrance to the complainant's hotel. the

The Respondent refused to dismantle the cameras. Also have the

Respondent does not care whether data is stored and if so, how

Long.

8. The Respondent submitted a statement on June 15, 2018 and stated that

that the recordings on a password-protected PC in a separately locked

Space 72 hours would be stored on a rolling basis that data processing as

former standard application is still justified and information signs

The question is whether the complainant through the image processing system

get hurt.

C. Findings of Facts

Based on the submissions of the parties, the following is stated:

The Respondent, with the consent of the then owner, Ms. Ulrike

H***, at the time of construction of the underground access tunnel in 1997/98,

which the complainant also uses as a car parking space in accordance with the law

video surveillance with four cameras will be installed in I***berg. Camera 1 monitored

the entrance to the garage, camera 2 the parking spaces of the respondent, camera 3

Respondent. An area of access to the complainant and the

Emergency exits are included due to the unity of the room. For the purpose of

Protection of property and the preservation of evidence are the recordings of the cameras

stored for 72 hours. The recordings are saved on a password-protected PC

stored in a separately locked room. The warning signs “Caution

Video surveillance Pension N*** Ges.m.b.H. & Co KG" were still during the

procedure before the data protection authority. The cameras have existed since the

Construction of the tunnel and a camera has been renewed in winter 2016/17.

evidence provided by the professional counsel of the parties to the proceedings. the

Conflicting claims result from differing views on the

lawfulness of data processing. It is undisputed that the area covered

Image processing system in the I***berg tunnel to monitor the parking spaces

Respondent is used. The recorded evidence about the

The storage period results from the submissions of the Respondent, whose

correctness is not doubted by the data protection authority.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

On the admissibility and timeliness of the complaint:

On May 25, 2018, the GDPR and the DSG came into force. The complaint, first

as a control and ombudsman procedure in accordance with § 30 DSG 2000, was due to the

Transitional provisions to be continued as a complaints procedure in accordance with § 24 DSG (§ 69

Para. 4 DSG).

The complainant is a legal entity based in Austria and is subsumed

the complaint under the basic right to data protection standardized in § 1 DSG, which

was not changed by the DSG.

Although the GDPR itself only protects natural persons,

constitutional interpretation to assume that the standardized in § 1 DSG

Rights also apply to legal persons and they consequently invoke them

be able.

According to Section 24 (4) DSG, the right to have a complaint dealt with expires if

the intervener not within one year after becoming aware of the

adverse event, but at the latest within three years after that

event alleged to have taken place.

As stated, the video surveillance that is the subject of the proceedings has existed for

1997/98, so for around 20 years. Nevertheless, the right to treatment is

Complaint is not statute-barred, because with a continuous data determination

The limitation period always begins anew (cf. the decision of the

Data Protection Commission of July 24, 2009, GZ K121.512/0012-DSK/2009).

The complaint must therefore be dealt with in substance.

Regarding the content of the complaint:

However, the appeal is found to be inadmissible.

The applicability of the GDPR or the DSG requires that data is actually

processed (Art. 4 Z 2 GDPR).

It is undisputed that the video surveillance that is the subject of the proceedings

natural persons are processed.

However, since the complainant is a legal person,

this by video surveillance impossibly in the right to secrecy according to § 1

DSG are violated because no data of the complainant is processed.

Data of natural persons that may be attributed to the complainant

can (such as servants or (co-)owners), cannot in this context

ipso facto be regarded as the complainant's data, since the

Rights under the GDPR and the DSG are highly personal rights that

are characterized in that their content is determined by the person entitled

becomes, so that through a change in his person, the content of the service itself also changes

changes (see also the decision of the Federal Administrative Court of

November 24, 2014, GZ W214 2008246-1, with further references).

The complainant also does not allege that she committed the alleged violation of rights

on behalf of and with the power of attorney of any natural persons affected.

In this respect, § 1 DSG differs fundamentally from § 16 ABGB; latter provision

can also be used according to the established case law of the Supreme Court

to take action against possible surveillance pressure from dummy cameras or the like.

In this case, the OGH also affirms the active right to sue a legal entity

to defend oneself against an (inadmissible) monitoring pressure (cf. the

Resolution of March 29, 2017, GZ 6 Ob 231/16p, with further references).

But since - as explained above - the applicability of data protection law

Provisions an actual data processing - and not just a possible one

Surveillance pressure - requires this case law of the OGH to § 16 ABGB

not transferable to § 1 DSG.

The appeal was therefore dismissed accordingly.
