Reason:

I

The following decision-relevant facts are due to the carried out

evidentiary procedure:

1.

On November 2, 2019, at around 7:35 p.m., the accused used the public toilet

Facilities on the upper floor next to the police station *** in [zip code] [town], [street, ONr]. searched there

2.

The accused then started the camera application on his mobile phone and

3.

The female person then left the toilet cubicle immediately and called for the accused

to also leave the toilet cubicle and hand over the mobile phone. The accused

then handed the used mobile phone out of the cabin, the female person took it

located in the toilet cubicle, were present. In any case, they were at this point in time

Image data of other naked women on the memory of the accused's mobile phone, the

 

this transmitted by work colleagues in the course of time before the incident in question

4.

Subsequently, the woman affected by the incident went in front of the

Premises of the women's toilet, where several other people are already using the

Toilets waited and described the incident to those present. A few minutes later he came too

Accused of leaving the premises of the women's restrooms and was taken away by the people waiting

5.

The police officers who intervened then postponed the questioning of the accused

The police could not find pictures or videos of the incident in the picture gallery

determine. The mobile phone used by the accused at the time of the crime has been in

around the end of January 2020 no longer in his possession because he had the device in a public place

Interrogation of the accused before the data protection authority of the TT. August 2020, GZ ***]

II. The determinations are made on the basis of the following assessment of evidence:

1.

The findings with regard to the criminal act of the accused, according to which his

Mobile phone with camera function, with activated front camera, under the toilet cubicle partition with

relevant information in the advertisement of the LPD *** and the corresponding statements

of the accused as part of his interrogation before the data protection authority.

2.

Regarding the question of whether the accused at any time had image data from the incident

stored on his mobile phone, no findings could be made. in the

As part of the reporting by LPD ***, it is stated that a corresponding

Image material when the officials inspected the device – the accused left that up to him

The accused himself states before the data protection authority that he never took photos

 

or saved video recordings of the incident. However, it cannot be complete

it can be ruled out that the accused has deleted any stored image material.

However, the question of whether image data was also stored can - what within the framework of the legal

assessment will have to be entered into – with regard to the behavior punished in the verdict

remain.

III. Legally it follows:

1.

Art. 83 (5) lit. a GDPR stipulates that in the event of violations of the provisions of Art

and 6 GDPR fines of up to 20,000,000 euros or in the case of a company of up to

4% of its total worldwide annual sales for the previous financial year

may be imposed, depending on which of the amounts is higher. According to § 22 paragraph 5 DSG

the jurisdiction to impose fines on natural and legal

Persons for Austria as the national supervisory authority at the data protection authority.

To the saying:

2.

The GDPR defines the term processing in Art. 4 Z 2 GDPR by listing

a number of possible uses. This includes the collection, recording,

the organization, ordering, storage, adaptation or modification, reading out,

the retrieval, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise

form of provision, matching or linking, restricting, deleting or

the destruction. The procedural use of the camera application of the

cellphones by the accused in order to – similar to a (digital) mirror –

Watching in a toilet cubicle represents a processing

The scope of Art. 2 GDPR is hereby opened. This legal classification results

based on a consideration of the technical process of digital image data processing

is. "Collection" is the gathering of data about the data subject. As long as the procurement is targeted

done, the way doesn't matter. The processor can retrieve data electronically,

 

Request documents or interview people. Also consulting an internet search engine,

to obtain information about a specific person falls under the term (cf. Ernst in

Paal/Pauly, General Data Protection Regulation, Art. 4 para. 23). Apart from that, every process that

personal data used, to be considered as processing, regardless of whether it is related to

or carried out without automated procedures. Already the collection of data is considered

processing (cf. Klabunde in Ehmann/Selmayr, General Data Protection Regulation,

Art. 4 para. 19). This means that the collection of data from data subjects using optical-technical devices (such as

video cameras) to qualify as processing within the meaning of the GDPR.

3.

Raising and grasping are not sharply distinguished; rising rather refers to

the targeted acquisition of individual data, while capturing tends to be continuous

recording of a data stream. Elevating and capturing can be done with one

storage; However, such a connection is not necessary (cf. Herbst in

Kühling/Buchner, General Data Protection Regulation, Art. 4 para. 22).

4.

Since in the demonstrative (Arg. "like") enumeration of Art. 4 Z 2 GDPR, among other things

the word "storage" is explicitly mentioned, it can also be assumed that this is the case

only one of the use cases of processing is concerned, and not theirs

basic requirement. Also that the Union legislature on a regulation regarding a

Live image surveillance, which can massively interfere with the rights of those affected, forgot or

deliberately wanted to exclude such monitoring from the scope of the GDPR

in view of the express aim of increased protection of the interests of data subjects in the

DSGVO are in any case not subject to the European legislator.

5.

Consequently, the subject of the proceedings is a processing of personal data in the sense

of the GDPR and the accused as responsible for this image data processing in

to qualify within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 7 GDPR; after all, he made the decision to be

using a smartphone to observe a female person in the toilet cubicle

he determined both the purpose and the means for data processing.

6.

On the lawfulness of image data processing:

Art. 5 GDPR lays down and determines the principles for the processing of personal data

its paragraph 1 lit. a, that personal data is processed lawfully, in good faith

and processed in a manner that is comprehensible to the data subject

(“lawfulness, fair processing, transparency”). As stated above,

Naturally, capturing image data in the toilet cubicle was not possible for the person concerned

 

foreseeable and this already constitutes a violation of the principle of Article 5 Paragraph 1 lit

GDPR.

According to Art. 6 GDPR, processing is only lawful if at least one of the

the following conditions are met:

a) The data subject has given their consent to the processing of data relating to them

personal data given for one or more specific purposes;

b) the processing is for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party

is necessary, or to carry out pre-contractual measures, which are carried out at the request of the person concerned

person take place;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation imposed by the

Controller is subject to;

d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or a

to protect another natural person;

e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task that is in the public interest

lies or takes place in the exercise of public authority that has been transferred to the person responsible;

f) the processing is to safeguard the legitimate interests of the person responsible or a

Third parties required, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of

data subject who require the protection of personal data prevail, in particular

when the data subject is a child.

Leads to the lawfulness of processing operations with regard to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR

Recital 47, among other things, explains that this is due to legitimate interests

of a person responsible can be justified, provided that the interests or fundamental rights and

fundamental freedoms of the data subject do not prevail; here are the reasonable expectations

of the data subject based on their relationship with the controller

consider. In any case, the existence of a legitimate interest is particularly careful

to be weighed up, whereby it must also be checked whether a data subject at the time the data was collected

personal data and given the circumstances in which it occurs,

can reasonably foresee that processing for this purpose may take place

will. In particular, when personal data is processed in situations in which

which a data subject cannot reasonably expect further processing

 

must, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject become the interests of the

those responsible prevail.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has already stated in the context of video surveillance that

that three cumulative requirements must be met for (image data) processing as

is to be classified as admissible (cf. the judgment of the ECJ of December 11, 2019, C-708/18, margin no. 40):

DSGVO are evaluated. This means that no further suitability testing is required

a weighing of conflicting interests. As the only suitable legal basis for the

the present image data processing would be a consent of the person concerned, this

is of course not available here and the data processing was therefore considered inadmissible in any case

to qualify.

IV. The following should be noted with regard to sentencing:

1.

According to Art. 83 Para. 1 GDPR, the data protection authority has to ensure that the

imposition of fines for violations referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 in each individual case effective,

is proportionate and dissuasive. In more detail, paragraph 2 leg cit states that in the decision

 

on the imposition of a fine and its amount in each individual case

due consideration is given to:

a)

Nature, severity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, extent or

the purpose of the processing in question and the number of people affected by the processing

people and the extent of the damage suffered by them;

b)

intentional or negligent breach;

c)

any measures taken by the controller or processor

to mitigate the damage caused to the data subjects;

d)

level of responsibility of the controller or processor

Taking into account the technical and

organizational measures;

e)

any relevant previous breaches by the controller or processor;

f)

Extent of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and

mitigate its potential adverse effects;

G)

categories of personal data affected by the breach;

H)

How the violation became known to the supervisory authority, in particular whether and

if applicable, to what extent the controller or processor acknowledges the breach

has communicated;

i)

j)

[...]

[...]

k)

any other aggravating or mitigating circumstances in the particular case, such as

financial benefits gained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, as a result of the infringement.

2.

According to Section 19 (1) of the VStG, the basis for assessing the penalty is the meaning

of the legal interest protected by criminal law and the intensity of its impairment by the act.

Moreover, according to the purpose of the threat of punishment, the aggravating and

Reasons for mitigation, insofar as they do not already determine the threat of punishment, must be weighed against each other.

Particular attention should be paid to the degree of culpability. Under consideration of

 

Sections 32 to 35 of the Criminal Code are a peculiarity of administrative criminal law

apply. The income and financial circumstances and any duties of care of the

Accused persons are to be taken into account when assessing fines; this only in

to the extent that the directly applicable provisions of the GDPR do not apply

supersede the provisions of the VStG and to the extent permitted by Art. 83 (8) GDPR

and recital 148 with regard to the procedural guarantees to be guaranteed

will.

3.

Art. 83 Para. 3 GDPR standardizes this in deviation from Section 22 Para. 2 VStG

Accumulation principle arranged that in cases of equal or related

Processing operations that intentionally or negligently violate several provisions of

GDPR is violated, the total amount of the fine does not include the amount

for the

exceeds the most serious violation. Thus, within the scope of the GDPR - as in

applied in the present case – the absorption principle of Art. 83 (3) GDPR.

4.

Based on the facts at hand, the following was determined when sentencing

considered aggravating:

-

Observing a female person with the help of a smartphone camera while she is

wants to use a toilet cubicle seriously interferes with the provisions of Art. 8 ECHR and

Art. 7 EuGRC protected legal interests of the private and intimate sphere of the persons concerned.

On the part of the accused, the image data processing was carried out with the

Intention to observe a female person in the adjacent toilet cubicle, granted

and therefore there is fault on the subjective side of the crime in the form of intent within the meaning of

Article 83 (2) (b) GDPR. The following was mitigating in sentencing

taken into account:

-

The accused took part in administrative penal proceedings before the data protection authority

and admitted to having carried out the image data processing, he has thereby to

contributed to finding the truth;

-

To date, the data protection authority has not had any relevant data against the accused

previous convictions.

6.

The concrete penalty imposed therefore appears taking into account the established one

Income of the accused measured with regard to the actual value of the crime

of up to € 20,000,000 in the available penalties of Art. 83 Para. 5 GDPR

and commensurate with guilt and its imposition required to protect the accused and third parties from the

committing the same or similar criminal acts.
