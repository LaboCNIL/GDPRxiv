Dear Mag. G***,

Impact assessment carried out.

Evidence Evidence: Evidence was recorded through the submissions of the

Responsible persons including attachments as well as on the basis of the official knowledge of the authority and

ex officio research on the website of those responsible.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. Regarding the competence of the authority:

Any supervisory authority is permitted to conduct investigations in the form of

carry out data protection checks (Article 57 (1) (h) GDPR).

According to § 18 Para. 1 DSG, the data protection authority is the national supervisory authority

Art. 51 DSGVO set up and entitled, at any time and without giving reasons

check those responsible. The data protection authority, based on the information provided by

responsible in (mandatory) reports of data breaches

Art. 33 GDPR had reason to believe that the person responsible comprehensively

processes special categories of data and has not appointed a data protection officer

has. The data protection authority therefore initiated the decision on July 16, 2018

official test procedure.

2. Regarding point 1 (mandatory appointment of a data protection officer):

In any case, those responsible appoint a data protection officer if the

Core activity of the person responsible or the processor in the extensive

Processing of special categories of data according to Art. 9 GDPR exists (Art. 37

Paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR).

The Guidelines on the Data Protection Officer of the Art. 29 Working Party on Data Protection

(WP 243 rev.01, available e.g. at

https://www.dsb.gv.at/europaischer_datenschutzausschuss_edsa) do

2.1.3, page 9, in footnote 14, commenting on this in terms of an extensive

Data processing “the processing of personal data […] not as extensive

[should] apply where the processing involves personal data of patients or […]

concerned and by an individual doctor, other health professional

[…] he follows".

For more information on what is meant by "extensive data processing".

can be understood can be found in the guidelines for data protection impact assessment (DPIA)

and answering the question whether processing within the meaning of Regulation 2016/679

"likely to involve a high risk", WP 248 Rev.01 (available at

https://www.dsb.gv.at/documents/22758/112500/Leitlinien+zur+Datenschutz-

Impact assessment-wp248-rev-01_de.pdf/2246301e-ffbb-4a03-bf23-797fee89174e), on

Page 11:

Accordingly, the following criteria must be taken into account:

a) Number of those affected, either as a specific number or as a proportion of

corresponding population group;

b) processed amount of data or bandwidth of the different processed

data items;

c) Duration or permanence of data processing;

d) geographic extent of data processing.

In view of that

a) the core activity of those responsible in the diagnosis and treatment of

Allergies - i.e. in the processing of health data according to Art. 9 Para. 1

GDPR – lies,

b) they have twelve office or laboratory staff, seventeen doctors and two nutritionists

busy and

c) store health data by law for at least 10 years

are (§ 51 ÄrzteG)

should therefore have come to the conclusion that – under

Consideration of the mentioned criteria - certainly an extensive processing

special categories of data according to Art. 9 DSGVO and therefore

a data protection officer should have been appointed.

Consequently, this breach of duty was to be determined in accordance with the verdict.

3. Regarding point 2 (inadmissible consent):

3.1. If the data processing is based on the consent of a data subject,

to take particular account of whether the fulfillment of a contract by the

Consent to processing of personal data that is necessary for

the fulfillment of the contract is not required (Article 7 (4) GDPR).

The person responsible leads to this in your form "Declaration of consent to

Data processing – Data Protection Act” from:

"[...] The unencrypted transmission of personal data (see
Information sheet on data protection on pages 2 and 3) is in accordance with

European General Data Protection Regulation not allowed because of the protection and
the integrity of the data cannot be guaranteed.

Therefore, the Allergy Day Clinic D*** needs an explicit and
written consent of all patients
to process personal data in the future and to do so unencrypted
send and receive (dispatch of findings by e-mail, telephone
Findings information, etc.)"

Under the part to be filled out by the person concerned (with name, date of birth and other

contact details) can be found, framed and with a pre-ticked box

provided the following text passage:

"I expressly agree that personal data
(especially information about my condition when I took over the consultation or
treatment, history of disease, diagnosis, den
Course of the disease, my findings and information about the type and extent
of advisory, diagnostic or therapeutic services
including the use of medicinal products) is processed and stored
and in unencrypted form to and from the accordingly
relevant third parties. The approval of the
unencrypted transmission can be used at any time with effect for the future
be revoked. I further agree irrevocably that the allergy
Day Clinic D*** at any time other companies and/or persons
carrying out the agreed service. this concerns
also the processing including storage of personal data. I
I acknowledge that the transmission of the data (unauthorized)
Third parties can obtain knowledge of the information and this data
can be changed. I understand that this is to disclose my
health condition can result. I am aware that the allergy
Day clinic D *** no liability for the correct and complete
transmission of the data."

3.2. The consent demanded from the data subjects turns out to be inadmissible

out.

3.2.1. First of all, the consent cannot be inferred with the necessary clarity for

which data processing the consent represents the legal basis. In the

The information provided according to Art. 13 GDPR is the legal basis

Consent is mentioned, but there are also other legal bases, such as the

Fulfillment of legal obligations or the protection of legitimate interests.

In this respect, it is unclear for which specific data processing the consent is given

legal basis is.

The declaration of consent therefore proves to be illegal in this respect (cf

also the decision of the data protection authority of July 31, 2018, GZ DSB-D213.642/0002-

DSB/2018; not published yet).

3.2.2. The person responsible binds the consent to data processing to a

Consent to the unencrypted transmission of data because it means the GDPR

stipulate a - not even indirectly derivable from the relevant regulations -

Obligation to transmit data in encrypted form.

However, we cannot accept any obligation to encrypt the transmission

a declaration of consent from data subjects. The question,

whether a transmission takes place in encrypted or unencrypted form is namely

one of the data security measures according to Art. 32 GDPR and thus solely from the

to judge those responsible. A consent within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit.

Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR is not permissible because the consent is not given here

serves to create a legal basis for data processing, but to

of - if necessary - data security measures to the detriment of

to be able to deviate from those affected.

For this reason, too, the requested consent proves to be inadmissible.

3.2.3. The declaration of consent also states that the data subject

"irrevocably" agrees "that the allergy day clinic D*** at any time other

Companies and/or persons to carry out the agreed service

may use. This also applies to the processing including storage of

personal data."

This passage can only be understood to mean that the use of

Contract processors are approved, for which the relevant regulations in Art. 28

Find GDPR. The decision as to whether a processor is used is up to you

also solely the person responsible, who also has the duty to carefully select and

to conclude a contract with a specific content with the processor.

Consequently, the use of processors is subject to the consent of data subjects

not accessible, which is why a relevant consent is not legally effective

can be granted. The consent therefore proves to be valid in this respect as well

unlawful.

Finally, it should be pointed out that an "irrevocable" consent in any case

of the GDPR, which therefore cannot be demanded (cf. Art. 7 Para. 3

GDPR) and any consent in this regard would also not be binding

(Art. 7 para. 2 GDPR).

3.2.4. The declaration of consent also contains the passage according to which those affected

Acknowledge "that through the transmission of the data (unauthorized) third parties become aware

about which information can be obtained and this data can be modified. It is ... with me

aware that this may lead to the disclosure of my state of health. It is ... with me

aware that the Allergy Day Clinic D*** accepts no liability for the correct and

complete transmission of the data."

Again, aspects of data security according to Art. 32 GDPR

addressed, of which by means of consent to the detriment of those affected not

can be deviated from. Rather, it is the duty of a person responsible adequate

to take measures to ensure that there is no violation of the

protection of personal data and consequently the requirements of the GDPR

are complied with (Art. 24 GDPR).

Consequently, this part of the declaration of consent also proves to be unlawful.

4. Regarding point 3 (violation of the information obligations):

4.1. In the information provided, no structural distinction is made as to whether it is in accordance with Art. 13

or Art. 14 GDPR is granted. However, this distinction is important in that

as information is also to be provided under Art. 14 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR is not

covers. According to Art. 14 Para. 1 lit. d, the information is to be given which

categories of personal data are processed; same is – different from in

Art. 13 - to also provide information about the origin of the data (Art. 14 para. 2 lit. f

GDPR).

According to the case law of the ECJ (judgment of October 1, 2015, C-201/14, still on

Legal situation according to Directive 95/46/EC, whereby this decision also applies to Art. 13

and 14 GDPR relevance) comes the information obligations an essential

importance, because the scope of the right to information in any case precludes the exercise of

to enable the right to information.

Apart from that, from the point of view of those affected, it is necessary for them to provide an explanation

can see clearly and unequivocally which data is collected directly from them

and which data may be used from other sources (see

see Art. 12 Para. 1 GDPR), which, however, involves different information obligations

tie

By not clearly distinguishing between the information requirements in the information requirements

Art. 13 and Art. 14 GDPR are distinguished, the person responsible has against them

obligations as well as Art. 12 Para. 1 GDPR.

4.2. As noted, the controller would have appointed a data protection officer

have to. In the information provided, Mag. Walter Josef Ä*** as

Named data protection officer, although he was not appointed as such. With that

gives the false impression that those responsible have a

Data protection officer who has all the guarantees of Art. 38 GDPR,

has ordered.

As a result, the person responsible has breached its obligation under Article 13 (1) (b) and Article 14

Para. 1 lit. b in conjunction with Art. 37 et seq. GDPR.

4.3. In the data protection declaration, only “Art. 5 para. 1b"

(probably meaning: Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) and Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a, lit. c and lit. f GDPR.

Since the person responsible is indisputably special categories of personal data

processed according to Art. 9 GDPR (namely health data), the

Legal basis for the processing of this data exclusively according to Art. 9 Para. 2

GDPR.

It is therefore the task of those responsible to check whether, given their field of activity

Art. 6 GDPR is relevant as the legal basis for data processing.

Because the person responsible has failed in its data protection declaration to

relevant legal bases for the processing of special categories

to provide personal data, contrary to its obligation under Article 13 (1) lit. c

and Article 14 (1) (c) GDPR.

4.4. According to Art. 13 Para. 1 lit. d and Art. 14 Para. 2 lit. b GDPR, a person responsible,

if the data processing is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR ("Processing to protect

legitimate interests of the person responsible or a third party”), the legitimate

List interests pursued by the person responsible or the third party.

If the person responsible does not comply with this obligation in their data protection declaration,

has violated the cited provisions of the GDPR.

It should be noted that this legal basis is exclusively for the processing of

Data that does not fall under Art. 9 GDPR can be used.

4.5. In the data protection declaration, consent is used as a legal basis for the

Data processing mentioned, but without – as required by Art. 13 Para. 2 lit. c or Art. 14

Paragraph 2 lit. d DSGVO required - to point out that a right to at any time

Withdrawal of consent exists without affecting the legality of the

Consent is affected by the processing that has taken place up to the point of revocation.

The person responsible therefore violated the cited provisions.

5. Regarding point 4 (violation of the obligation to check whether a data protection

impact assessment is required):

The person responsible explains that the data processing, which is carried out in its

Processing directory under II.B. “Patient Management” trades, not one

"written" data protection impact assessment (DPIA), since

the exceptional circumstances of § 1 in conjunction with DSFA-A12 apply according to the annex to the DPFA-AV.

In this regard, it must be stated that the person responsible can already be seen from the explanatory notes

(available on the website of the data protection authority) should have established that the

Patient Management - Limited to the subject of managing the records that

usually also occur in customer administration - only then not to a DPIA

undergo if it is administered by a single physician.

For the processing activities

 Patient files (address, billing and registration data)

 Settlement (settlement with social security)

 Request for findings/transmission of findings (transmission and disclosure),

 Examination of samples (examination and dispatch of samples [blood,

secretion etc.]),

 Management of prescriptions (storing which prescriptions patients

require),

 Pharmacy (operation, administration, billing and organization of

medicine chest),

all health data known to those responsible is managed,

disclosed and transmitted. Thus, from the wording of Art. 35 Para. 2

lit. b DSGVO clearly shows that in these cases the examination of the necessity of a

DPIA would have been required.

According to § 2 Para. 3 Z 1 DSFA-V, the extensive processing is subject

personal data according to Art. 9 GDPR in any case to a DPIA if

in addition, at least one further criterion according to paragraph 3 is met (for "extensive

Processing" see again the guidelines on data protection cited above

impact assessment).

It should be noted that the DPFA-AV and the DPFA-V do not

contain concluding enumerations, but only processing operations

list, which in any case are subject to one or no DPIA. Is a

The processing operation is not covered by one of the two regulations

Those responsible have the obligation to check in each individual case whether a DPIA is required or not

not. The already cited guidelines on data protection

impact assessment are used.

It is therefore the responsibility of those responsible, based on the above

To check whether the data processing mentioned here is subject to a DPIA

are subjected to or not.

However, since the person responsible assumed incorrectly that

in any case, if it did not have to carry out a DPIA, it has, contrary to its obligation under Art. 35

breach GDPR.

6. Regarding the performance mandate (paragraph 5):

The performance mandate is based on Art. 58 Para. 2 lit. d GDPR. A time limit of eight

weeks seems appropriate to meet the performance mandate.
