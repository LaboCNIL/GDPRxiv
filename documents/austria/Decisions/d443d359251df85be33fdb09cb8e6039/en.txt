stated that the BF had terminated his contract with "N*** Mobilfunk" on September 30, 2018

and the last outstanding invoice was settled on November 26th, 2018. On 12/2/2018

the BF submitted an application for information in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR to "N*** Mobilfunk". The

Letter dated December 24th, 2018, received by "N*** Mobilfunk" on January 4th, 2019, the deletion

requested his personal data. In a letter dated January 8th, 2019, "N***

Mobile communications" informed the BF that the data will be sent immediately after the legal

operational purposes). According to § 100 TKG, the latter also refers to

Individual call records. Since the contract was terminated on September 30, 2018,

the last traffic data on March 30, 2019 is automatically deleted. The rest of the data

replied that it was clear from the pleadings of "N*** Mobilfunk" that

the last traffic data on 3/30/2019 and the remaining data by means of automatic

Deletion routine - whereby the BF could not understand what was meant by this -

Purpose of providing information about the deletion and the deletion itself. The reference

on the data protection declaration and on relevant civil law norms is not

expedient, since the BF would in turn be forced to hire a data protection expert

commission what cannot be within the meaning of the regulations. The Respondent

regulations.

21.12.2018 listed data kept. The retention period is seven years

from the end of the contractual relationship or the end of the year in which the

contractual relationship has ended. The legal basis for this storage is

§ 132 BAO and § 212 UGB, since the data mentioned serve as the basis for entries in the

serve books or are in documents (invoices and others

invoice-relevant documents) that serve the same purpose. So it is about

these data and documents are "records" and "receipts" within the meaning of the above

Provisions that would be subject to corresponding retention requirements. The

Need to become. It is not known to him what traffic data or traffic data is about

B. Subject of Complaint

Based on the arguments of the BF, it follows that the subject of the complaint is the question

is whether "N*** Mobilfunk" violated the BF's right to deletion by

did not comply with his request for deletion of December 24th, 2018.

C. Findings of Facts

1. "N*** Mobilfunk" operates a telecommunications service and had with the

Complainant concluded a mobile phone contract, this on November 26, 2018

ended.

2. In a letter dated November 4th, 2018, the BF submitted an application for information to "N***

mobile communications".

3. "N*** Mobilfunk" provided the following information in a letter dated December 21, 2018:

 

[Editor's note: the graphic file (letter from N*** Mobilfunk dated 12/21/2018

regarding information according to Art. 15 GDPR to the complainant) was removed because

it cannot be displayed pseudonymised in the RIS.]

 

4. The BF submitted a request for deletion in a letter dated December 24th, 2018, which is contained in this

Information listed data.

5. "N*** Mobilfunk" responded to the cancellation request with the following letter dated

01/08/2019:

[Editor's note: the graphic file (letter from N*** Mobilfunk dated 01/08/2019

regarding request for deletion to the complainant) was removed because it was in the RIS

cannot be displayed in a pseudonymised form.]

6. "N*** Mobilfunk" has the BF's traffic data for a period of six months

stored, which were deleted by means of an automatic deletion routine on March 30th, 2019

became.

Evidence assessment: The findings are based on the undisputed and

credible submissions of the BF and "N*** Mobilfunk".

D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. Regarding the concept of master data or traffic data:

The BF complains that he does not know what master data or

traffic data. According to § 97 Para. 3 Z 3 TKG, master data is

all data, including personal data, necessary for the establishment, processing, change,

or termination of the legal relationship between the user and the provider or

are required for the creation and publication of subscriber directories. These are:

Surname (surname and first name for natural persons), academic degree

natural persons, address (residential address for natural persons),

subscriber number and other contact information for the message, information about

Type and content of the contractual relationship, creditworthiness, date of birth.

According to § 92 Para. 3 Z 4, traffic data is data that is used for the purpose of

Forwarding of a message to a communications network or for purposes of

billing of this operation are processed.

With regard to the information provided by the complainant from "N*** Mobilfunk" (see

Findings) it must be stated that these are only master and

Contract data as well as interactions with the customer service of "N*** Mobilfunk".

Traffic data cannot be extracted from it. This also brought "N***

cell phone" in its statement of March 19, 2019, which the complainant in

was transmitted as part of the hearing of the parties. This was in the present proceedings

irrelevant, however, since the object of the complaint was only one alleged

violation of the right to erasure.

2. Re points 1 and 2

§ 97 paragraph 1 TKG standardizes a strict earmarking for the processing

personal data.

According to § 97 paragraph 2 TKG 2003 master data are at the latest after the end of the

to delete contractual relationships with the participant from the operator. exceptions

are only permissible to the extent that this data is still required in order to pay fees

charge or bring in, process complaints or other legal

to fulfill obligations.

"N*** Mobilfunk" relies on the storage of master data on the

seven-year period of § 132 BAO and the seven-year period of § 212 UGB.

Section 132 (1) BAO and Section 212 (1) UGB each standardize a retention obligation

of books and records for seven years. From the issued on December 21, 2018

Information (specifically: table regarding communication with the complainant)

shows that "N*** Mobilfunk" processes personal data of the BF and

refused to delete those from the period from 02/23/2004 to 04/30/2011

come. According to § 212 Section 1 UGB or § 132 Section 1 BAO with seven years

a specific retention obligation is thus the basis for their retention

disregarded as this data is more than seven years old. Another basis for

further processing of this data was not submitted by "N*** Mobilfunk" and

is also not recognizable. This data older than seven years would be from "N***

portable radio" had to be deleted independently after the end of this period.

The complaint was therefore to be granted on this point and the deletion of this data

to apply.

3. Regarding point 3

To the traffic data:

According to Section 99 (2) TKG 2003, the operator of a public communications network

or service to store traffic data, provided this is for billing purposes

End customer or wholesale service charges is required. The traffic data is closed

delete or anonymize as soon as the payment process has been carried out and

the fees have not been objected to in writing within a period of three months.

The provision of Section 99 TKG 2003 sets Art. 6 of Directive 2002/58/EC of the

European Parliament and Council of July 12, 2002 on processing

personal data and protection of privacy in the electronic

Communications (Privacy Policy for Electronic Communications; ePrivacy

RL) (cf. Feiel/Lehofer, Telecommunications Act 2003 [2004] 290).

According to Art. 6 Para. 4 e-Data Protection Directive, a distinction is made between the processing of

Traffic data for billing purposes (Art. 6 Para. 2 leg. cit.) on the one hand and

Processing for the purpose of marketing electronic communications services or

to provide services with additional benefits (Art. 6 para. 3 leg. cit.) on the other hand.

Such a distinction can also be found in the definition of § 92 para. 3

Z 4 TKG 2003 (arg. "or").

Section 99 (2) TKG 2003 authorizes the processing of traffic data

settlement purposes regulated. According to the wording of the law, the

to delete or anonymize traffic data after a period of three months

unless one of the exceptional circumstances set out in Z 1 to 4 applies.

The processing of traffic data for the purpose of marketing electronic

communication services or to provide services with additional benefits (Art. 6

Para. 3 e-Privacy Directive) is regulated in § 99 Para. 3 TKG 2003, whereby in this

Provision also Art. 6 Para. 4 e-Privacy Directive was implemented (cf. again

Feiel/Lehofer, loc.cit., 290). According to Section 99 (3) TKG 2003, the scope of the processed

Limiting traffic data to the absolutely necessary minimum.

As the data protection authority already in a comparable complaint procedure

has expressed, a longer storage period than that specified in the law is available

three months not in accordance with Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. e GDPR (cf. notice of

Data Protection Authority from May 28th, 2018, GZ DSB-D216.471/0001-DSB/2018). This

According to the regulation, personal data must be stored in a form

which allows the identification of the data subject only for as long as is necessary for the

purposes for which they are developed ("memory limitation").

In the present case, "N*** Mobilfunk" was therefore only authorized to transfer traffic data

Billing purposes according to § 99 paragraph 2 TKG 2003 for a maximum of three

months or until the expiry of the periods specified in nos. 1 to 4 of this provision

save.

As submitted and established by "N*** Mobilfunk", the traffic data

of the BF already deleted on March 30, 2019. "N*** portable radio" brought in their statement

from March 19, 2019 that "master data and other data associated with a phone number

are linked as well as invoices and all invoice-related information within

be deleted from seven years after the end of the contract

Statement that "traffic data [...] according to § 99 TKG within six

Months after the creation" of "N*** Mobilfunk" can be deleted. As to the present

Time at which time the traffic data of the BF have already been deleted - the deletion

took place as stated on March 30th, 2019 - the complaint was therefore on this point

dismissed due to lack of appeal by the BF.

Regarding the other master data:

For the other personal data of the complainant, which is in the information

from 21.12.2018 - but are not older than seven years - are concerned

Information about the type and content of the contractual relationship and thus provide

Master data within the meaning of § 92 Paragraph 3 Z 3 lit. e TKG 2003. "N*** portable radio" is therefore

authorized to use this master data in accordance with § 132 Para. 1 BAO or § 212 Para. 1 UGB for the duration

to be kept for seven years (cf. Riesz in Riesz/Schilchegger, TKG [2016] § 97

40 and the decision of the data protection authority of May 28, 2018, DSB-

D216.471/0001-DSB/2018).

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.
