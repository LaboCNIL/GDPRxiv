A. Procedure

REASON

The DPA removed the section “Information & Privacy:

CONSENT under data protection law in accordance with Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR

Marketing purposes" in the form "I will become a new B*****-Automobilclub member" of the

B***** automobile clubs to initiate an ex officio test procedure, since the

There was a suspicion that this section did not meet the data protection requirements of the

DSGVO correspond.

The B***** automobile club replied in its statement of June 25, 2018 in the

Essentially, that the procedural section meets the criteria of the GDPR

correspond to In particular, the consent in question is designed in such a way that the

data subject can decide by ticking the boxes provided

whether and in what form they would like to receive marketing mailings. Also be the

pre-formulated declaration of consent clearly structured and therefore corresponding

of the GDPR in a comprehensible and easily accessible form.

B. Subject of the proceedings

Based on the above argument, it follows that the subject of the proceedings in

This ex officio test procedure the question is whether the B ***** automobile club its

Pre-formulated declaration of consent drawn up in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR

has.

C. Findings of Facts

The B***** Automobile Club sent out recruiting forms to its members

new members.

The form is divided into two parts. The first part contains personal

Data of the member himself, the second part is with "I will be a new B***** automobile club

Member" and is used to collect personal data of new members.

In the second part of the form, under the “Information and

Data protection” following passage (format and typeface not true to the original

reproduced):

"Data protection consent in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR
Marketing purposes: I consent to the B***** automobile club my
personal data (first name, surname, club card number, address,
telephone number, e-mail address) for the purpose of sending/notifying information
about new offers, products and services such as in particular about S*******,
Club items, driving safety training, R****** and V****** products

Oh by mail

O by electronic means of transmission

Oh by phone

processed and sent to the national associations of the B*****-Automobilclub* and the others
Companies in the B*****-Automobilclub-Verbund** (incl. B*****-Automobilclub GmbH) for
transmitted for these purposes. The use of the data to provide the services
Membership and S******* is independent of this consent.
Withdrawal: I can revoke this consent at any time by email to widerruf@b*****-
automobilclub.at or letter to B*****-Automobilclub, 1**0 Vienna, X**y**Zstraße 2*
withdraw. By withdrawing your consent, the legality of the up to
Revocation does not affect the processing that has taken place."

Below that is a new section that applies to the entire form, with

a text field for date and signature.

Evidence assessment: The findings are based on the results of the

investigation procedure, in particular on the procedural form of the

B***** automobile clubs themselves.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

In the present case, the B***** automobile club uses in its

Form a pre-formulated declaration of consent. With such a

The declaration of consent is a consent under data protection law

Art. 4 Z 11 GDPR (emphasis added by the data protection authority):

Article 4

definitions

For the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:

[...]

11. "Consent" of the data subject any voluntary for the specific case, in
informed manner and unequivocally given expression of will in the form of a
Statement or other unequivocal affirmative action by which the
the data subject indicates that they are compliant with the processing of data concerning them
agrees to personal data;

Art. 7 GDPR standardizes the conditions for GDPR-compliant consent and

reads as follows (emphasis added by the Data Protection Authority):

Article 7

Consent Conditions

(1) If the processing is based on consent, the person responsible must prove it

can that the data subject in the processing of their personal
data has consented.

(2) If the data subject gives his/her consent in the form of a written declaration

concerns other matters, the request for consent to
understandable and easily accessible form in a clear and simple language like that
be made that it is clearly distinguishable from the other facts. parts of
Declaration are then not binding if they violate this
represent regulation.

(3) The data subject has the right to revoke their consent at any time. Through
the withdrawal of consent will invalidate the legality of the consent
processing that took place up until the revocation is not affected. The person concerned will
informed of the submission of consent. The withdrawal of consent
must be as simple as giving consent.

(4) When assessing whether consent was given voluntarily, the circumstance in
to the greatest extent possible, whether, among other things, the fulfillment
of a contract, including the provision of a service, from which
Consent to processing of personal data is dependent
are not required for the performance of the contract.

The following criteria for a DSGVO-

derive compliant consent: voluntariness, specificity, information, comprehensibility,

easy accessibility, clear and simple language.

In the case at hand, the criterion of comprehensibility is primary

dubious:

Since this is a written declaration of consent, Art. 7 Para. 2 Sentence 1

GDPR applies and the request for consent must therefore be in an understandable and

easily accessible form, in clear and simple language in such a way that it is

clearly distinguishable from the other circumstances. The B*****-

Automobile club itself correctly in its statement that a pre-formulated

The declaration of consent should be clear and concise.

The subject matter is the pre-formulated declaration of consent of the B***** automobile club

however, in a form that gives the data subject the impression that

only being able to decide through which medium you want to receive marketing mailings

would like to receive, namely by post, by electronic means of transmission or by

Phone.

In addition, the general structure of the form, specifically, supports the placement of the

Declaration of consent according to Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR directly before the signature, which

confirming the registration for membership contributes to further ambiguity. The affected

Individual can give the optional consent to the processing of personal data

for marketing purposes as a mandatory part of the form and

assume that for membership also consent to such

Processing is necessary because the signature of the data subject only after this

text passage is set.

Also through the reference to the

With the possibility of revocation, the impression is given that data processing is allowed

In any case, having to agree to marketing purposes and only through the possibility of one

revocation to be able to prevent data processing for such purposes ("opt-out"

solution which is not permitted by the GDPR; cf. Buchner/Kuhling in

Kühling/Buchner, General Data Protection Regulation1 (comment) Art. 7 margin no. 26).

As a consequence, such consent is also voluntary

questionable.

As the B***** automobile club also correctly explains here, consent is then

granted voluntarily if the data subject can freely decide whether and in what form

she agrees to the data processing that is the subject of the consent. Since that

This form offers a choice as to whether the data subject is at all

consents to the processing of their personal data for marketing purposes

or not, not explicitly contains and through the placement of the procedural

Text passage before the signature field suggests that the signature also

at the same time constitutes consent in accordance with Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR, is from the perspective of

Data Protection Authority also not given the element of voluntariness.

The form of the B***** automobile club that is the subject of the proceedings therefore does not correspond

the requirements of Art. 7 Para. 2 in conjunction with Art. 4 Z 11 GDPR and was the data protection authority

therefore in accordance with Art. 52 (2) lit. d GDPR

obviously meant Art. 58 Para. 2 lit. d GDPR] for the production of the legally compliant

entitled to instruct the B***** automobile club within a set period,

his pre-formulated declaration of consent in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR

to adjust.

A period of three months seems appropriate, the declaration of consent

to adjust.
