B. Test item

It must be checked whether the processing of biometric data carried out by means of

Palm vein scanner by the municipality of Z*** is carried out lawfully and thus the DSGVO

is equivalent to.

C. Findings of Facts

The municipality Z*** is the operator of the seaside resort Z***. For access control purposes

the seaside resort for season ticket holders became a palm vein scanner in May 2019

Installed. The investment costs were 50,000 euros. This is done via the adjustment

the vein pattern of the palms a biometric identity check. To the

The palm vein sensor uses infrared light to record the vein image

being absorbed by the red blood cells in the veins. This will change the vein structure

made visible to an infrared camera and thus forms the basis of the biometric

pattern.

To purchase a season ticket, it is a requirement that the vein pattern of both

To have palms recorded at the checkout and from now on every time you enter the

Seebad to use the palm vein scanner. An alternative access option is for

Season ticket holders no longer provided. Access without palm vein scan is as

Bathing guest only possible by purchasing a day ticket.

The price for a day ticket for adults was 4.50 euros in 2019. for one

Season tickets for adults were charged at 50 euros.

Furthermore, you are only entitled to open the access barriers with a season ticket in order to

as a tenant with access rights to a boat mooring to those in the seaside resort

to drive to boat berths. Opening the access barriers using a

Day ticket is not possible.

Before the vein pattern when purchasing a season ticket for the first time at the checkout

is recorded, bathers must sign the following declaration of consent:

all last queried by the data protection authority on December 12, 2019). The Findings

to the entrance fees of the seaside resort Z*** result from the information on the

Community website, https://www.z***at/feizeit/seebad (requested by the

Data Protection Authority on 12.12.2019).

D. In legal terms it follows that:

D.1. To the official test procedure

The data protection authority initiated on the basis of Article 58 (1) (b) GDPR

ex officio review procedure ("data protection review") against the municipality of Z*** (in

Consequence: operator) who operates the seaside resort Z***.

D.2. On the distribution of roles under data protection law

The operator is responsible for the biometric access control she carries out using

Palm vein scanner according to their own statements (point 19 of the submitted

Processing directory) as the person responsible for data protection pursuant to Art. 4 Z 7

to qualify for GDPR. Municipality Z*** also appears on the form shown above

for the declaration of consent, giving outsiders the impression that

that the municipality Z*** is responsible. In the opinion of the Municipality of Z***

is stated on p. 2 that the seaside resort as a private enterprise

community is led; more information and evidence that this

Operation is also to be qualified as the person responsible within the meaning of the GDPR, but are in the process

didn't come out.

The data protection authority therefore comes to the conclusion that the municipality of Z***

Responsible according to Art. 4 Z 7 DSGVO for the processing of data by means of

palm vein scanner is.

D.3. Processing of biometric data

According to Art. 4 Z 14 DSGVO are "biometric data" with special technical

Procedures obtained personal data on the physical, physiological

or behavioral characteristics of a natural person that are unique

Enable or confirm identification of that natural person, such as facial images

or dactyloscopic data.

According to Art. 4 Z 2 GDPR, “processing” means anyone with or without help

process carried out by automated processes or any such series of processes in

connection with personal data such as collecting, capturing, the

Organizing, ordering, storing, adapting or changing

Reading, querying, use, disclosure by transmission,

distribution or any other form of provision, matching or

association, restriction, deletion or destruction.

Images of palm vein patterns are - as noted - with a special

technical process (using infrared light). palm vein pattern

are among the physiological characteristics of a person, can be a natural

clearly assign a person and thus enable the clear identification of a person

natural person. Palm vein pattern as biometric data within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 14 GDPR

are therefore undoubtedly also personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 1 DSGVO. For the

Use of the palm vein scanner for access control purposes

Hand vein samples recorded by data subjects, iSv Art. 4 Z 2 GDPR

processed.

In principle, the processing of biometric data applies in accordance with Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR

to uniquely identify a natural person as processing special

Categories of Personal Data (“Sensitive Data”). The processing of this data

is prohibited unless the processing is based on one of the items listed exhaustively in paragraph 2

Intervention facts can be supported. An exception to this is according to Art. 9 Para. 2

lit a. GDPR if the data subject is involved in the processing of the said

personal data for one or more specified purposes expressly

has consented.

D.4. Principles for the processing of personal data

Article 5 GDPR reads:

Principles for the processing of personal data

(1) Personal data must

a) lawfully, fairly and in a manner that is fair to the data subject

be processed in a comprehensible manner ("lawfulness, processing in good faith
faith, transparency”);

b)

collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not in any
further processed in a way that is incompatible with those purposes; one
Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, for
scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes
not considered incompatible with the original purposes in accordance with Article 89(1).
(“earmarking”);

c) adequate and relevant to the purpose and necessary for the purposes of the processing

be limited to what is necessary ("data minimization");

d) accurate and, where necessary, up to date; it is all

to take reasonable measures to ensure that personal data with regard to
the purposes of their processing are incorrect, be erased or rectified immediately
("Accuracy");

e)

stored in a form that allows identification of data subjects only
for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed;
personal data may be stored longer if the personal
Data subject to the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational
Measures taken by this regulation to protect the rights and freedoms of
data subject are required, exclusively for purposes of public interest
Archival purposes or for scientific and historical research purposes or for
statistical purposes are processed in accordance with Article 89 paragraph 1 ("storage limitation");

f)

processed in a way that ensures adequate security of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or
unlawful processing and against accidental loss, accidental
Destruction or accidental damage by appropriate technical and
organizational measures (“integrity and confidentiality”);

(2) The person responsible is responsible for compliance with paragraph 1 and must

Be able to demonstrate compliance (“accountability”).

 

The ECJ states in its case law that the processing of personal

Data relate to at least one fact according to Art. 7 of Directive 95/46/EC

(now: Art. 6 GDPR) and in Art. 6 of this guideline (now:

Art. 5 GDPR) must comply with the principles set out (judgment of December 11

2019, C-708/18, margin no. 36).

These principles also include the principle of data minimization according to Art. 5

Paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR.

D.5. General information on the principle of data minimization

The principle of data minimization is the reduction of

Processing of personal data to the essential. The data minimization

ensures that the processing is qualitative for the specified processing purpose

and is quantitatively limited.

Data minimization means that data processing is appropriate and appropriate for the purpose

be substantial and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of the processing

got to. Adequacy is the proportionality test

narrower sense. The relevance denotes the suitability within the meaning of the

constitutional doctrine of proportionality, i.e. whether a

data processing is conducive to achieving the purpose at all. With the restriction

to the extent necessary, it is finally made clear once again that the data is not

may go beyond the purposes. This requirement is regularly

adequacy and relevance consumed [cf. instead of many

Hötzendorfer/Tschohl/Kastelitz in Knyrim, DatKomm Art 5 GDPR Rz 34 ff (as of

1.10.2018, rdb.at)].

D.6. General information on data protection consent and the prohibition on coupling

According to its own statements, the operator supports the processing of personal data

Data of affected persons for the purpose of access control in Seebad Z*** only on the

Legal basis of the consent according to Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR.

According to Art. 4 Z 11 GDPR, "consent" of the data subject means any

voluntarily for the specific case, in an informed manner and unequivocally

given declaration of intent in the form of a declaration or another clear one

affirmative action by which the person concerned indicates that they are with the

processing of the personal data concerning you.

In accordance with Art. 7 GDPR and taking into account Art. 4 Z 11 and recital 43

GDPR, consent must be given voluntarily and may not be linked to the fulfillment of a

contract, although this consent to the performance of this contract is not

is required. Consent is involuntary if, in the event of non-submission of the

consent, a disadvantage is to be expected (cf. the decision of the data protection authority

from April 16, 2019, GZ DSB-D213.679/0003-DSB/2018).

The former Art. 29 Data Protection Working Party has dealt with the concept of the

"Consent" employed and an analysis of the term made. She has

also dealt with the disadvantages that prevent voluntariness and is

came to the conclusion that such a disadvantage exists when

Risk of deception, intimidation, coercion or significant adverse consequences

consists. The controller must demonstrate that it is possible to obtain consent

refuse or revoke without suffering any disadvantages. A responsible person must

for example, demonstrate that refusing or withdrawing consent is not

leads to costs for the data subject and consequently to a clear disadvantage.

Furthermore, the controller should prove that the data subject is a real or

had a free choice whether to consent or not (cf. Art. 29 Data Protection Working Party, guidelines in

Reference to consent pursuant to Regulation 2016/679, WP 259, rev. 01 p. 12; cf. also

recital 42 GDPR; see also the decision of the data protection authority of

30 November 2018, GZ DSB-D122.931/0003-DSB/2018).

The element "free" implies that the individuals concerned have a real choice and the

have control In general, the GDPR requires that consent is not

is valid when the data subject has no real choice to consent

feels pressured or suffers negative consequences if she does not comply.

When consent is a non-negotiable part of terms and conditions, it will

assumed that the consent was not given voluntarily. Art. 7 para. 4 of the GDPR

points out, among other things, that a situation in which the consent with the

acceptance of contract terms is "bundled" or the performance of a contract

or the provision of a service with a request for consent to a

processing of personal data necessary for the fulfillment of the

contract are not required, is considered to be highly undesirable. Will

consent given in such a situation is deemed not to have been given voluntarily (cf.

recital 43 GDPR).

When the controller is performing a contract with a request for consent

linked, a data subject who gives the person responsible their

does not wish to make personal data available for processing,

consequently runs the risk of being denied the services she has asked for (cf.

again the notification of April 16, 2019).

When coupling the consent to a processing of non-contractual

personal data with the conclusion of a contract is fundamentally of this

to assume that the granting of consent is not voluntary, if not in

Individual case special circumstances for a voluntary data protection

Speak consent (see the judgment of the Supreme Court of August 31, 2018, GZ

6 Ob 140/18h mwN).

According to the case law of the data protection authority, it must also be taken into account that a

voluntary consent can be given if a certain processing operation

also to the recognizable advantage of the person concerned (cf. instead of many the

Notice of March 8, 2006, GZ K178.209/0006-DSK/2006; cf. also Kotschy in

Brodil (ed.), Data protection in labor law [2010] 3).

D.7. In the matter

lawfulness of data processing

Since specific categories of personal data are processed,

the lawfulness of the processing is based exclusively on Art. 9 Para. 2

GDPR.

A - legally compliant - consent is the legal basis according to Article 9 Paragraph 2 lit

GDPR under consideration.

In this context, the question arises as to whether the form “Consent to

the collection, processing and storage of biometric data within the meaning of

General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679" consent to the processing

personal data of the data subjects standardized in the GDPR

meets requirements.

In this specific case, season ticket holders - as has been established - are entitled to use the

Palm vein scanners required. Purchasing a season ticket requires that a

Declaration of consent is signed, otherwise only the purchase of a day pass

possible. There is an alternative access option (without using the palm vein scanner).

it does not for season ticket holders. If a data subject does not give such consent

from, the consequence and the clear disadvantage is that no season ticket for

to be able to purchase the seaside resort. Those affected have real choice and control

therefore not people.

With reference to the general statements on the ban on coupling (cf. D.6.), it is

obvious that the consent under examination is not "voluntary". the

Possibility to purchase a day pass without using the palm vein scanner

does not constitute a lawful alternative option because the data subject will no doubt be affected by it

considerable additional costs would arise, as already argued by the

Shows those responsible, especially in the case of season ticket holders, the objective

wanting to use a biometric verification system to avoid misuse. Apart from that

of which is the use of the boat berth only with a season ticket - and not with

a day ticket – possible.

In this context, it is also necessary to check which processing operations are carried out for the

fulfillment of the contract (provision of a service) are required at all. The

The ban on coupling only includes consent that is not necessary for the purpose of the contract

required are. The "necessity" is to be measured against the purpose of the contract. core purpose

the purchase of a season ticket is the seasonal use of the seaside resort and the

associated infrastructure.

From the point of view of the data protection authority, the consent to the data processing has been given

a palm vein scanner is not required to use the infrastructure. Is required

only that there is access control to the seaside resort to prevent unauthorized persons from entering

prevent use.

As a result, it can be stated that the ban on coupling violated and consent to

the data processing under examination is inadmissible.

In the absence of permissible consent of the persons concerned in the processing of the biometric

(and thus special category of) data and in the absence of applicability others

Exceptions within the meaning of Art. 9 Para. 2 GDPR, there is a lack of one under review

Legal basis for lawfulness of processing.

For this reason alone, the data processing in question proves to be

unlawful and consequently non-compliant with the GDPR.

Proportionality / Data Minimization

Even if one relies on legitimate consent (or another legal basis)

out, the data processing in question would still be disproportionate and

consequently does not correspond to the principle of Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR.

Personal data may only be processed if the purpose of the

Processing cannot be reasonably achieved by other, milder means

can (cf. recital 39 GDPR and the already cited judgment of the ECJ of

December 11, 2019, margin no. 47 f).

The former Article 29 Data Protection Working Party also issued a statement on the

Risks of biometric technologies pointed out and the

proportionality test highlighted (cf. Article 29 Working Party,

Opinion 3/2012, WP193):

“When using biometric data, the question of proportionality arises
of the data processed in the individual categories against the background of the
for the purpose of the respective processing. Because biometric data is only used
if they are appropriate and relevant and not excessive
The scope must be covered, the necessity and proportionality of the

desired result could not also be achieved with means which the

The purpose of the data processing in question is access control

Seebad Z***.

The operator herself states that the use of the palm vein scanner also

serve to prevent the season tickets from being passed on.

However, the expected benefit is disproportionate to the biometric test carried out

Data processing:

Biometric data is inherently personal, unique and not

amendable and therefore by its very nature with regard to fundamental rights and

fundamental freedoms particularly sensitive. They deserve special protection because in

There are significant risks associated with their processing (cf. also

recital 51 GDPR). The question of proportionality is in view of the of the

The purpose pursued by the operator must therefore be checked strictly.

The processing that is the subject of the procedure would only be permissible if the purpose of the

Processing cannot reasonably be achieved by other means.

However, that is not the case in the present case.

Couldn't be a milder alternative to access control with a palm vein scanner

transferable season tickets are issued with a photo of the ticket holder that

either controlled and reconciled upon entry by staff (such as this

is also common in the Viennese baths, cf.

https://www.wien.gv.at/freizeit/baeder/zugangspreise/monatskarten.html, retrieved on

December 6, 2019) or which are randomly checked in the seaside resort (as with

a ticket inspection on public transport). Such an approach

would also be looking at the investment costs of 50,000 euros and ongoing

Maintenance costs of the palm vein scanner reasonable.

In addition to the principle of lawfulness of processing is therefore also the principle

violated data minimization.

The data protection authority also does not overlook the fact that the operator comprehensive

technical and organizational measures have been taken, however, the aspect of

Security of processing for the proportionality test iSd

data minimization principle itself irrelevant. It is only necessary to check whether it

There are milder means of achieving an end that involve less severe intervention for those affected

mean people. Since there are - as explained - such milder means, in the

specific case violated the principle of data minimization and is also from this

reason to assume the inadmissibility of the subject data processing.

The security of the processing would at best be within the framework of the principle of integrity

and to check confidentiality (Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR), according to which personal

Data must be processed in a way that ensures adequate security

personal data, including protection against unauthorized or

unlawful processing and against accidental loss, accidental

Destruction or accidental damage by appropriate technical and

organizational measures. Furthermore, security measures iSv

Safeguards to prevent or mitigate unreasonable consequences for

Those affected who were implemented by the operator as part of a

Weighing of interests within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR must be taken into account (cf. on the

Key factors to consider in a balancing of interests, Art. 29-

Data Protection Working Party, Opinion 06/2014 on the concept of legitimate interest

controller according to Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC, WP 217,

844/14/EN, p. 43). Such a balancing of interests occurs when examining whether

there are milder means of achieving the purpose in accordance with the principle of data minimization,

However not. The technical and organizational measures taken were important

therefore not go into any further at this point.

D.8. Result

Since the data processing under examination lacks a permissible legal basis

has already taken place unlawfully, but on the other hand also disproportionately (Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. c

GDPR), the operator was to be given a corresponding service contract and the

Prohibit data processing and delete the existing ones

apply personal data.

The performance mandate is based on Article 58 (2) lit. f and g GDPR.

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.
