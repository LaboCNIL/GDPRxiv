## GDPRxiv: Establishing the State of the Art in GDPR Enforcement

We propose a method to establish the state of the art (SOTA) in GDPR enforcement. We design and implement GDPRxiv: an information archival system that collects and curates GDPR rulings, judgements, reports, and official guidances. GDPRxiv consists of 8000+ official precedents and guidances, the largest such collection. To demonstrate the usefulness of this corpora, we share insights gleaned at the aggregate-level (say, how is the GDPR being enforced in the field) and at the content-level (say, what are the common failures and antipatterns observed in the field while implementing RTBF). 


This repository is organized as follows:

1. The `pygdpr` folder contains all the source code to build GDPRxiv crawler.

2. The `documents` folder contains GDPR official precedents and guidances.
